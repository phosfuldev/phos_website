#### What happened 

I screenshoted A's repost of what Keiran said about getting prepared and survival skills, and vaguely said "this is a weird take". A reached out about it and we talked a little bit and had some public back and forth.  
At the time I didn't understand the core of the issue so I responded unreasonably and escalated the situation.  

(keeping "A" anon as I cannot confirm with them if they're ok to be mentioned, and they're not a public figure) 

(saying the fact that I was responding to A's repost is just to be clear, but I still understand my behaviour had the most impact to Keiran and Mob and that's the important part) 

I will put more details at the end so you can look if interested. 


#### My apology 

I shouldn't have casually and vaguely "critiqued"/criticised a Blak person/their views in front of people, and I apologise for that. Even without meaning to, the impacts of my actions is the same if I *wanted* to misunderstand them or purposefully went to attack and confuse them. My action became another one of settler's recurring/ongoing attempt to wear out Mob and discredit their efforts. My lack of consideration and my inability to see the issue when confronted also showed deeply ingrained racism and lack of respect towards Mob. 

My understanding of what Keiran said is biased and incomplete, but I didn't see this at the time, and reacted based on that. I apologise for reacting carelessly and irresponsibly, and making it someone else's problem. I also apologise for causing harm to others when interacting on this issue. When someone reached out for accountablility, my first reaction was to talk about "my side of the story" instead of listening. That was not helpful and make me unsafe to receive criticism and be in community with. I will strive to correct this in the future. 

I had an emotional response, but the issue is far beyond individual emotions. Normalisation of colonial power imbalance allowed me to act like this towards a First Nations person's views, and to be very defensive when challenged, and I ended up reinforcing structural racism. It's a cycle we have to make the effort to break. 

I do think ableism and sanism is widespread (both in general and in "left" spaces) and we should be more aware and talk about it. But this was not the right place or the right way. And if I want to talk about it in a more grounded and realistic way as a settler living in this colony, I need to increase my understanding of colonisation and decolonisation, otherwise I will repeat my mistakes and undermine First Nations resistance. 

I thank Keiran for his posts on ["Bad faith engagement"](https://www.instagram.com/p/DGAccOSTqIO/) and ["Decolonial theory"](https://www.instagram.com/p/C_ujAc2zHLi/). I will start to read/listen/watch more history and analysis, including BPU's [library](https://www.blackpeoplesunion.org/peoples-liberation-library) and other resources.

I thank A for first bringing up the issue with me. 

I also want to thank a few friends for gently holding me accountable, explaining the issues, and listening to me when I sort out my thoughts. Your time, patience and understanding is greatly appreciated. I couldn't have made the same progress in isolation. 


#### More confessions related to this indicent

##### Survival skills

Of course, it's not Mob's responsibility to make sure settlers have adequate skills. Actually, Keiran and [BPU](https://www.blackpeoplesunion.org/) has worked hard to put together resources to educate us. Keiran isn’t saying “get prepared” out of individualism and elitism and that is clear through what he does for the community, and the context of Indigenous resistance. 

Since settlers benefit unfairly from colonialism and caused/are still causing Blak people’s suffering, we have a responsibility to support Indigenous-led resistance, uplift Blak people from systematic oppression and make their survival easier. Not the other way around. 

I knew these ideas but as you can see, I didn’t fully understand and embody it. If I saw that story and asked: “hey, these are my skills, how should I share them in a way accessible to both me and others, so the community survive better?” This conversation would probably be more productive. 


##### My lack of relationships with Mob

I have not been proactive about forming relationships and working with local Mob whose land I'm on, and that's on me. It's certainly not on Mob to make me comfortable enough to reach out, but I always have a responsibility to do so as long as I live on this stolen land and benefit from genocide as a settler. I admit I’m uncomfortable about it in part because of being a settler and afraid of doing something wrong, and I need to work on this, including building up basic understanding and history knowledge, so that I am more safe to be around. I think that would make me less "insecure" too. 


##### My social media behaviour

I also want to acknowledge, over time on Instagram, I have been messaging people "unprompted" under their stories to share my thoughts, many times in disagreement or partial disagreement. I apologise for the hurt this has caused. I have started to reflect about this since I saw someone point it out recently before this incident, but I'm just gonna make it clear that I have committed more to learning and *implementing* communication techniques, like checking if people want to hear any feedback first before expressing it. 



#### Double standards, pointing fingers

After this happened, I thought about how I dealt with other conflicts in the past. I could see a trend becoming clear. 

First, let's break down the obvious double standards in my response and thinking.

I felt like since Kieran didn't make 100% clear what he meant, I was "free" to interpret it in a way that felt "natural" to me, guided by how i initially felt. But when what *I* said was interpreted differently, I was unhappy; A said my interpretation was in bad faith, I denied because I "didn't intend to", but I felt attacked and felt *they* were seeing *me* in bad faith. I thought I could explain with "I can understand how you took it that way, but I didn't mean that..."

I have also been hypocritical towards A's story post about myself in the same way. I initially thought, I was just casually mentioning it, externalising my thoughts as they come just like I always do, but their post was more like an intentional, serious attack. But I can see now, if the roles reversed, my stories would be felt in the exact same way. 

Overall, I wasn't able to approach what I saw and what people said to me with more curiosity and humility, instead I assumed shared context and... I guess I could see inside their heads? At the same time, when I read what others said about my words, I often thought "but they don't even know me". 

I dodn't want to come to a white person (? as far as I know?) with disagreement especially after I felt our previous interaction could be disgenuine, but I didn't realise I'm commenting on Indigenous survival and resistance as a settler and there's a power dynamic there too.

Now I break it down like this, it's very obvious.  
First of all, don't knowingly use double standards like this.  

But why did I do this "unknowingly"? Why did I not see this at the time and why was it so hard to accept this?

I reacted to what Keiran said because of my previous experiences of "survivalist talking points". I was activated and acted with less care and patience, and the other side matched my energy, which made me feel more hurt. Each action pushed for escalation. Everyone felt they're not being heard and got increasingly more frustrated. But everyone also had a choice to break out of that cycle at any point. Instead of saying "they could, so they should have done it first", we need to ask ourselves, why not me? If we react just because s
The underlying logic is: If you don't follow certain actions, I don't need to follow my principles when interacting with you. If we all withold care unless we get it first (to whatever standard we set during the moment or at any time), there will be no progress towards radical community care.

This made me deeply reflect how I'm acting on my values, if I'm doing that at all in some areas, and how should I make sure to do so in future. I always talked about treating each other with kindness and curiosity, the need to build real relationships despite trauma and online algorithms, but I still have a long way to go. When this happened, I started thinking "why was *I* not treated with kindness and care *first*?"  

All these things I listed above happened quickly, I didn't leave any time to pause or think of alternatives.

A lot of us are tense in this time, it feels like too much is at stake, and too little progress is happening. This isn't to excuse what I did, but instead I want to say, learn from my example. even if we are tense, we still need to treat each other like how we want to be treated. like we depend on each other. Otherwise, we'll just continue the cycle of harm.




#### Appendix. More details on what happened

Below 4 screenshots was what was posted "publicly", a back and forth between me and A:

The initial story I saw and reposted:
![Screenshot of A's instagram story, which is a repost from Keiran. On the top section there is a meme with a comically drawn character with a mullet haircut and glasses, and text says: "Absolutely - I believe 100% that society will collapse from climate change within 20 years. That's why my life plan is: 1. live in a big city, 2. specialise in white-collar or artistic work, 3. cultivate 0 practical skills". Keiran then added: "Learn how to source and grow veges, how to maintain soil quality, what is edible/toxic/medicine/etc. Learn how to hunt and trap, learn how to skin an animal and tan it's hide. Learn how to weave and sow, how to make linen and other textiles from plants so you can clothe yourself. Learn how to build yourself a shelter, how to start a fire in the bush, how to keep yourself warm and safe. Learn how to purify drinking water, learn about water cycles, flood plains, how to aerate a dam. Poetry and art might sustain the soul, but it does nothing to sustain the physical body. I'm sorry to say but the Right are doing way better in this regard than most of the settler left. If society collapsed tomorrow how long would you actually survive? We all like to have grand ideas about what we would do and how much we would thrive, but be honest with yourself - would you actually survive the first 24hrs? The first week? Could you set up the systems to feed, water and clothe yourself indefinitely? "](/assets/images/A-Keiran-initial-sc-1.png)  

What I wrote in my repost:
![Screenshot of the previous, posted by me, with words added: "weird meme to support, and weird 'take' in general... you know what I'm about to say lol. I do agree 'the right' is doing these prep better but maybe also they have more resources as a whole because their existence is about upholding their existing priviliges (I know there are poor/immigrant etc right wingers but they're also not the ones doing these prep)"](/assets/images/A-Keiran-my-initial-reaction-2.png)  

Then A posted in response to me:
![Screenshot of the previous stories, posted by A, with words added: "Weird comment to make and weird approach to dialogue, next story for why this is so rude and why it annoyed me so much. (ALso just incorrect. Working class fascists are making that preparation. Like another comrade said, this is just bad threat modelling)."](/assets/images/A-Keiran-response-to-me-3.png)  
After this story, A posted more stories on how they analyse this situation. 

Then, I responded to that as well:
![Screenshot of the previous stories, posted by me, with words added: "well maybe I didn't want to talk to you..?? ableists don't just change because we reach out first and talk to yall. this is from experience. the eye for an eye 'public humiliation' is funny too. whatever, another white person outta my life, I'm dealing with this better than before for sure (crying emoji). I'm pretty sure someone tipped me off so I'm gonna remove a bunch of people from here. *you* could have reached out to me too, but no I don't deserve that now that I've 'made a mistake'. "](/assets/images/A-Keiran-my-seond-reaction-4.png) 

Once again, I apologise for how I handled this, and I regret having done it this way.

I think you can also see how each response escalated more than the last, and each response had a number of assumptions. Let that serve as an example.
