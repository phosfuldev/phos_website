I have learned a lot from [Butter](https://www.instagram.com/buttereffectunplugged), [Asiatu](https://www.asiatucoach.com/), [Candice](https://www.patreon.com/RadicalSurvivorSpace), [Samirah](https://www.patreon.com/theSapphicSIren), and others, on this topic, and I thank them for their work. As always, communities the most impacted have the best understanding to teach us.

### Concepts and definitions

#### Ableism

Ableism is discrimination against disabled people, and the belief that a certain "normal" way of functioning is superior and or correct. It is a dehumanising ideology, and much like other oppressive ideologies, it runs deep in a lot of societies especially colonies, and people are often unaware that they hold ableist beliefs. Many things like physical spaces or processes, are designed to be difficult and confusing for disabled people.  

#### The social model of disability

The social model of disability is a newer model of understanding compared to the medical model.  

The medical model sees the problems as medical and to be dealt with/relieved by medical professionals, sees individual as "defective", "abnormal" and "in need of fixing", and places the problem solely on the disabled individual.  

The social model says disability experienced by a person is produced from the interaction of the person and the environment. "The social model seeks to change society in order to accommodate people living with impairment. It does not seek to change persons with impairment to accommodate society. It supports the view that people with disability have a right to be fully participating citizens on an equal basis with others." "For example, it is not the inability to walk that keeps a person from entering a building by themselves, but the stairs that are inaccessible to them." (quotes rom [this article](https://pwd.org.au/resources/models-of-disability/))

#### Disability justice



#### Sanism


#### Mad liberation



#### Psych abolition

### Applying the concepts to real life

I want to talk about some common ableist/sanist talking points below. Most of these I have also learned from the people credited above and more. 

But before I do, I want to note one more thing. I’m aware the “critique culture” in certain leftist spaces/held by some of us, even tho a habit, are not productive or helpful, especially for building relationships and community. The below examples contribute to that culture, as it literally brings up and examines examples of what isn’t ok and why I’m against certain things. Some of them could be things you, the reader, have done before. I still think it’s necessary to talk about them, but be aware - everything applies within context, there's rarely a clear black and white, "right" or "wrong", "based" or "harmful" judgement with these examples when they do happen in real life.

#### Access isn't a burden

The simplest, most surface level problem I have with the initial quote about "being prepared"/"getting ready", is it doesn't consider people's ability to access how to learn and or practice the necessary skills, hence it's unhelpful and alienating.  

Let me list a few scenarios. (I don't experience all of them, they are just examples)

How will I learn gardening if I don't have a garden? If I don't even get sun where I live? If I don't have a friend who has a garden that I can get to? If I can't make it to a community garden? What if the community space is not covid/infectious illness safe?

How do I learn identifying plants if I am isolated and don't know anyone with the skills, and can't afford to pay for lessons, or the timing doesn't work with managing other essential tasks? 

What if I'm busy surviving? And this doesn't just include working a job.

1) Some say, stop making excuses, you just need to be creative and make it work, you just need to really put your mind to it.

What make these access barriers "excuses" to you? Why is the focus on the individual's "failures" and not the communities? Why not talk about the non-existence of community for many in the first place (and no it's not because of they're "bad people")?  
This is individualistic and dismissive.  
And access barriers, like systematic oppression, often compound each other. If I don't have money to pay for a bus ride to the community garden, what else do you think I may have to deal with in life?

I don't know what *your* leftist circle is like, but from my perspective, many "aware" and anti-oppression(?) people are themselves dealing with oppression (often multiple/compounded) and struggling because of it. We have to start this project of "getting prepared", from **now**, from each of our current reality. Reality for some of us looks like working a full time 9-5 job and endless consumption on the side. For some of us it looks like being completely isolated and cut off from opportunities to grow.  

If you *have* those skills, if you have some time, please start sharing them. I always see the above talking point without this follow up. People who know how to hunt will say "learn how to hunt", but not "if you're in X area, join our hunting group" (even if you are gonna have a strict interview peocess or something, I'm not coming for that). People who know about foarging and gardening have not said "I'm offering my skills for free every month at X time so margenalised communities can increase food security". If we seem to agree that community care is essential for survival, then who's actually not practising community here?  

2) Some others say, well, nothing can be inclusive for everyone.  

Why? Who taught you that?  

If we are dreaming big, outside of the current systems and the limits in our mind, why not?

> I also think these access issues shouldn't be treated as invidual problems or solved individually. Like, oh you need a ride to comminuty garden, let's find that and that will be it. Let's not stop there. Let's model access issues together and treat them all seriously. Let's make access a part of planning any community project. And I understand all these things needs resources and people's energy to achieve, so they can't be achieved with a snap of finger out of nowhere. but we can have community projects that prioritise access, and improve on it whenever possible, rather than seeing it as a burden or obstacle, see it as an invitation.  

3) And there is another question, what if any "valuable work" is too much for my body? what if the only thing I can do is create art or write poems in bed? What if gardening work or cooking triggers my chronic illness? Who defines "valuable work"? I'll discuss this more in a later section.  

"well this isn't what I was talking about". Well but if every single suggestions, or opinion piece that touch on the idea of coming catastropy, just talk about "easy things you can do to be prepared!", this is how it feels to disabled people.  



#### The "useful"-ness of disabled* people

Some of the "left" often has a problem with seeing people only as useful tool to push the goal (be it "the revolution", "communism" or whatever). This shows when people say "if I haven't seen you at protests, I won't be including you in xzy when abc happens".

And if you really want to talk about "usefulness", I want to quote Samirah and () here: Disabled people help us understand care. Disabled people help us dream. Sure, you can say none of these *alone* will "achieve the revolution", but the lack of 



#### "that's just in your head"

I want to dive into access for "mentally ill" people. Traumatised people.

Maybe someone would suggest "if you have social anxiety, then you need to overcome it in order to start forming community." "if you are isolated, you need to reach out to people instead of waiting for them to find you" etc etc.

There is a therory in psychology, that to heal from trauma, we need to experience our triggers in a safe environment.

I'd argue there isn't a single person that doesn't live with trauma. And yet, **we** are the healing that we need.
