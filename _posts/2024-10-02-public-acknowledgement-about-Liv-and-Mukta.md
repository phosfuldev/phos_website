This is a copy/archive of an instagram post I (and Mukta) made (well, technically 2 posts, because it was too long), with some parts slightly edited for the website reading experience, and even more details that we couldn't add to the post itself - "reciepts", so to say - to the end.  

It also serves as a screen reader friendly version of the post!  

Important note: unless you are someone who knows Liv well and can be gentle and supportive to them, and actually get across to them, we do not encourage people to reach out to Liv directly about this incident.

Also I haven't figured out how to resize images on wide screen yet so if you're viewing on a computer, apoligies for large images (for now), they didn't need to be that large xx

Now enjoy :)  


#### Introduction  

I'm sharing what happened publicly, despite a part of us feels “this is not that important, do you really need to be talking about it”.  
Part of why it feels like “maybe not important” is because in the end, “nothing bad really happened”.  
Now I want to say in affirmation: Lack of emotional safety and gaslighting IS part of structural violence.  

We feel often people who are systematically disempowered choose silence, and for good reasons, but we want to speak up this time.  

A lot of us have been burned by self proclaimed allies, abolitionists, activists etc. Which is another reason we want this to be communicated to the public. 
This is an important lesson both for people who claim these labels, and vulnerable, oppressed people to see it for what it is, know when to protect yourself, and know we're here for you if you go through the same thing.  

During the time we organised our thoughts and worked on this post, it became no longer about trying to get through to Liv. but we want to say that in general, public accountability is needed after harm is done and false narratives have been spread, in public. If Liv wishes, they can still do their part. Someone else said it, activism is not private self improvement.  


#### What Happened  

Thursday night (AEST) (Sept 19th), I got a message from my friend Mukta about a conflict with Liv.

Mukta has sent a resistance poem with explicit imagery to Liv without preface or asking for permission, after Liv shared a personal experience with SA in a post. 

Liv is angry about recieving and being made to read what Mukta sent and blocked Mukta soon after. By the time Mukta saw the messages and tried to communicate further and apologise they found they were blocked.

##### The poem

**Please engage mindfully or skip this part if you need to.**  

Sitting on your high chair  
Plush chair  
you tell me  
You'll be gentle  
You'll take it slow  
y'all be gentle  
Y'all be slow  
different chair  
different height  
y'all be gentle  
y'all take it slow  
and you think it's a gift  
a token  
a key  
a card  
oh she this oh she that  
tell her I'm understanding  
I'll be gentle I'll take it slow  
I nod I nod until I cannot  
I smile even blush until I cannot  
you never get it do you  
fuck your gentle fuck your slow  
I'll burn your chair and do it rough  
I'll teach you all dick -taking is the same  
and do it rough  
I'll teach you until you can nod  
a knife is a knife gentle or not  
I'd ask you are you scared babygirl  
if I were to shove this knife into your ass it would take you so gentle  
I'd take it slow  
or whatever way you want  
plenty choices  
Your holes your choice  
the knife always on the table  
what you say  
call it love making?  
But you wouldn't get it  
all dick-taking is the same  
to you hate and resistance are the same  
you say violence is violence  
so when I burn it all  
in the end  
I'd be so gentle  
I'd take it slow  
destroy the constructs of a- dick  
teach you not all violence is the same  
teach you my resistance is not your hate  
teach you how this gentle this slow is a violence  
teach you how this resistance this fire this knife is me not letting this kill me  
tell y'all  
I'd never be so gentle  
never take it slow  

##### (end)  

(Can I just say, damn the more I read this poem the more I fall in love with it...)  

After hearing what happened I wanted to check if Liv said anything publicly about this.  

I saw Liv posted about this incident in their stories and showed Mukta's page (screenshot below; all screenshots at the end) asking people who know Mukta talk to Mukta.  

![screenshot of Liv's instagram story. The background image is a screenshot of Mukta's instagram profile page, you can see Mukta's bio, and the fact that Mukta's profile is private and Liv wasn't following Mukta at that moment. Overlay text says "For clarity, this is the person who sent those messages. I'm not saying to stop pushing for mutual aid and supporting this person. But perhaps somebody who actually knows them could tell them to not fucking do this and that it's extremely harmful. (line break) Every one who posted about supporting this person follows me. Please talk to them."](/assets/images/Screenshot_Liv_16.jpg)  

a couple of hours later, Liv commented on the mutual aid post about Mukta and asked me to read their stories, I guess to make sure I didn't miss it.  

I responded to the comment by dming Liv. In my message I agreed about Mukta's mistake. But I had to point out the contradiction between the way they are reacting and their values.  

Liv has not replied and I think I'm blocked too (not sure when).  

After we're both blocked, I no longer have a way to check what Liv may have said about this incident or us, but we have mutual aquaintances(?) so I heard and saw some things via them in the next few days. I want to acknowledge I didn't see all that was said so I will just comment on what I did see.   


#### Analysis

> Note: I used Mukta's direct words in some places of this analysis. This post was the product of both of our labour.  

it is true Mukta isn't close with Liv, and shared something potentially triggering without warning or asking for permission.  
Mukta is taking accountability here and would like to engage in repair with Liv.  

Mukta have asked me to communicate to the public, that they realise their mistake and will do better in the future by practicing warnings/consent as needed, as it is important to them to show and practice care to people.  

<br>

On the other hand, Liv's reaction to being hurt, is to cease direct communication and cut the opportunity to repair.  

And, __publicly brand someone__, a disabled mad comrade in the global south*, who rely on social media to stay alive and is battling known and unknown dangers every day, __as a violent person__. This is also not ok.  

Liv's actions could have put Mukta in great danger. I'm glad it hasn't turned out so so far but we are both still weary. Continuing to talk about this could be dangerous for this reason. But again we didn't want to be silent anymore.  

and even after naming and blocking Mukta, Liv refuse to be in communication about this with others (eg. me) when I wasn't completely supportive, and is not proactive about any transformative justice procedures.  

<br>

I understand reacting emotionally in the moment (not a negative thing in itself), so initially we were hoping one day we'll be unblocked, and we'll talk things through, or someone who know Liv well can be a mediator if talking to us is too confronting for Liv.  

This is seeming less likely by the day especially Liv appears to have moved on - they stopped bringing it up in public as far as I can know, and they're not reaching out directly or through a third party. I could be wrong here because again I can't see. But my point is Liv isn't directly saying NOR signalling to us that they want to resolve this.  
Is Liv happy to publicly brand someone violent after they're hurt then just call that done? As far as I understand that’s not very transformative justice.  

<br>

Liv was hurt, then they used their platform to retaliate. I'm sure it was for venting and seeking support too, but the retaliation is there.  

Maybe this is not the intention but this is the impact.  

When this is called out (by me privately), Liv simply chose to ignore and silence us.  

Mukta felt threatened and endangered, and was worried about what else may be done for days. Of course they did.  

<br>

Now, important context: Liv is white and Mukta is Indian, living in India.  

i hope everyone are up to date as best you can with what came to light recently (and ongoing) in India regarding sexual violence, so i won't explain here. if not, ask and we can point you to sources. heavy CW if you're going to look it up.  

Liv's reaction and how they have dealt with this overall and ongoing is rooted in whiteness. Keep this in mind when you read the following analysis.  

<br>

Liv put the attention of their followers on Mukta in a very particular way.  

First they shared a screenshot of them sharing the mutual aid post for Mukta. I made that post, for Mukta's safety, it only tagged Mukta in the caption and did not include Mukta as a collaborator.  

__then they *specifically* shared a screenshot of Mukta's profile page and said "this is who I'm talking about". as if to say, make no mistake, it's the person, not just the actions.__  

__They also went to the Mutual aid post for Mukta to comment. The mutual aid post. It is possible people may see that comment and decide against supporting Mukta.__  

Regardless of intention or emotions, this caused harm to Mukta.  

It seems like Liv went out of their way to discredit Mukta's character and the mutual aid effort for Mukta and discourage people from supporting.  

__I know Liv explicitly said otherwise, I'd argue here believe the action (multiple actions) not the words.__  

it seems to me, calling out Mukta's name, and making sure their version of the story is seen (and believed and validated), is more important to Liv, than really making sure Mukta has learned their mistake.  

Liv should know Mukta relies only on mutual aid to sustain their life and how grim the situation is. the post that they posted a screenshot of said so clearly. This shouldn't be unfamiliar or hard to believe to Liv - they seemed like someone who would understand the struggle of trying to communicate the extent of your abuse and pain when it's so extreme.  
Unfortunately this is a pattern - a brown person's suffering is less real and less important to white people.  


#### Now let's get into some details.

**Detail 1.**  

In response to the poem, Liv said to Mukta (DM reply) "why did you send me this?" "is it intended to be directed towards me?" and "please explain yourself".  
and then Liv publicly said on their story asking "someone who actually knows them could tell them to not fucking do this"  

but now Liv doesn't seem to care about what comes out of the questions they asked or "someone talk to Mukta". This disparity and the "flexibility" to switch to whichever most convenient narrative is a sign of power.  

**Detail 2.**  

Liv blocked Mukta quickly after asking for an explanation.  

it is understandable in a way, but also to assume someone living in a dangerous, abusive household and in a different country, different timezone, to constantly have access to their phone and able to respond instantly is a misjudgement to say the least.  

**Detail 3.**  

Liv said Mukta is "someone I do not know".  

First, this makes it seem like this is their only interaction with Mukta, which is not the case.  

Another thing about this is - this can be an individual difference, but I think we all would benefit from getting to know the mutual aid recipients we are supporting, even just a little, even slowly.  
if for security they're anonymous, we can ask about them and get to know them through the organisers. mutual aid unlike NGO is human to human.  
And of course, do what you can here, there's no shame in not having energy to get to know 10s and 100s of people. but using "I don't know them " to protect your own comfort, to distance yourself, to refuse to engage at your own convience is insidious.  

**Detail 4?**  

When I responded to Liv’s comment via dms, I wasn't overly nice in my messages, I didn’t vehemently apologise on Mukta’s behalf or condemn them, because it is not necessary and to expect such is to assume one pain is more valid than the other - white behaviour.  
I also unfollowed them and removed them as a follower on my private account only. I don’t know if that was interpreted as being hostile and contributed to me being blocked.  

at that point I already saw what Liv posted, I saw what they were willing to dish out against Mukta.  
At that point I could not be nice and accomodating to them and I did not feel safe to have them around my personal space.  
At least I was neutral because people deserve that. But that wasn't enough.  

<br>

All of what I said about what happened, or what I chose to focus on, can seem like "small" or maybe "reading too much into things" to a unsuspecting onlooker.  

But these small details can in fact tell us A LOT. and we'd all do better to watch out.  
There are actually MORE details I could have gone through but didn’t due to space. If you read the appendix, let me know if you noticed extra things in the comments ;)  

This whole time Liv intrinsically understands their privileges and used it naturally "when needed". The fact that it's so natural should make we all think.  
Uncountable amounts of these incidents, all the tiny little details included, continues the default power structure and oppression in our daily lives.  

<br>

There is also a more “hidden”/insidious aspects of this incident.  

In Liv’s story posts (that I have seen), Liv naturally positioned themselves as a victim, and the (only) one.  
They’re presenting their reality as the “good” and hence “correct” one.  
They defined Mukta’s action and intention and the interaction and (lack of) future interaction. They became the authority in this situation.  
Mukta said: “Liv successfully managed to manipulate even my own understanding of my poem and myself in this situation”.  

What Liv said in public and the way they said it also feels like they're not expecting to be challenged, not leaving room for disagreement (unlike me here I’ve been emphasising “I could be wrong” and very careful about my words in general), and they expect how they endangered Mukta won't even be noticed by their supporters/friends.  

<br>

Liv was in control of how this incident progressed in the public eye.  

We couldn’t talk to them privately;  
Mukta is not in a position to post about it publicly;  
I as a third party had to be very careful and deliberate about posting about it publicly...  

In fact, I did want to immediately talk about it publicly. I knew instinctively though, if I was not careful, if I say a wrong word, what I could face. (What JUST happened to Mukta is proof what could happen to me.)  
I only said the bare minimum I believed had to be said immediately (I posted about “be careful of those stories” immediately after I saw them in my private stories, and after days of carefully thinking I poted on my public account about it very vaguely).  
I also didn’t want to “add fuel to the fire” - we wanted to resolve this rather than turn it into a shouting match.  
All these cautions, did not help us. The result was just - Liv shaped the public narriative from the first moment, and they would have completely, if we decided to not post this.  

When you have power, having control of the narriative feels only natural, and you don’t even notice it.  

<br>

We have to be aware of the power we hold, even in moments of being hurt. The systems are set up in a way that in almost everything, the “natural” reaction we have is steeped in power imbalances too.  
This is obviously situational, and I’m not trying to victim-blame. It’s also relative. someone can be the one in power in one interaction/situation, and be in a different role in a different situation.  

Even when we react out of trauma responses, power imbalance still exists and will always hurt the party with less systematic privilige.  
This incident cannot be reduced to only a trauma response for this reason. That would be white neutrality - the one with power can be afforded the innocent excuse but the same will not be applied to the oppressed party; and a form of sanism - trauma response don't make us hurt people, using power over people and reinforcing systems of oppression do.  


#### Lessons in this incident:

1. Read and understand the mutual aid call outs you boost and support. This is not a big ask compared to what people are going through. If you have extra energy/time, and if it's possible, get to know them and talk to them.  

2. whiteness is invisible to the white person. power is invisible to the person holding it. this is why others calling it out is crucial and should be listened. this is part of decolonising your mind. Yes it’s uncomfortable. This is also why white people needs to take a back seat because it’s so easy for yall to do harm and not even aware and because of power not get called out at all.  

3. people with power can easily NOT practice what you preach, because of different default reality, comfort, your progression in unlearning not “there yet”... Be ok with listening to people when they bring up something uncomfortable. You’re bound to mess up and accountability is a gift.  

4. community and movement NEEDS open discussions, disagreements, to go forward. Also, when someone cuts someone off, when “drama” happens, notice most of the time who still have access to community support and spaces regardless what happened, and who now needs to tiptoe to get support (material or emotional).  

These “lessons” points I have seen many people like [Butter](https://www.instagram.com/buttereffectunplugged), [Asiatu](https://www.instagram.com/asiatu.coach), [Candice](https://www.instagram.com/candicealaska), [Nat](https://www.instagram.com/namaca___) talk about, just recently, and many others over time. Just giving credit where credit is due!

We can all use these broader points to reflect how we are going to deal with mistakes and repair. I'm not going to be super specific here but I'm happy to elaborate if people want.  

And I was gonna talk about “using proper CW” here but after so much thought, I think that actually distract from the main problems this situation present to us, and sort of puts a comparison between what Mukta did and what Liv did - to make such a comparison is to minimise what Mukta experienced and to give Liv’s actions legitimacy. To equate Mukta's mistake to Liv's violence would also be an act of oppressive violence. This is not me “condoning” anything, but whatever. At this point, if you get it you get it!  


#### Finally - Aspiring/Self-proclaimed abolitionists and activists:  

You can talk all the theory you want but when you face a BIPOC person's life, and you see and feel, close up, the power in your hand over them (IF you do), at that moment how you act is more important than any theory you will ever say or write. This will always be the most fundamental and important. And you will face many such moments.  

Just like each settler upholds the settler colony, each person especially white person that does not critically examine their actions builds on the death machine.  


#### Final meta note:

this post was a LOT of work, mental work. I now understand very closely what people go through when they write a post like this.  
Me and Mukta needed to hone in our intention, find the best words that can't be misinterpreted, make it objective and inoffensive and "polite"... but also keep our perspective and voice clear.  

we felt like we have to be perfect and there's pressure if we don't see some criticism coming and address beforehand, then everything we say may be discredited because of one point we missed.  
we know we have to try very hard to convince because our struggles and pain, when put side to side as a white person's, literally seems less, and less important to people.  

this is what anyone have to prepare when you're doing something perceived hostile to someone with power, and power itself, as someone that power doesn’t align with. but the other party can just say whatever they want to say in the moment regardless of what impact it may have and put it behind them.

#### Appendix 2 - some DMs that was mentioned in the post

![Screenshot of Liv's messages to Mukta. Messages from Liv says: 1. "WTF? Why did you send me this?" 2. "This is incredibly violent and you have sent it to me without my consent. Is it intended to be directed towards me? I'm about two seconds from blocking you after receiving this so please explain yourself." Mukta then replies "It's a poem I wrote, abt/against gendered violence/misogyny. I read one of your post recently and I shared this hoping it would give you some power, as in giving my solidarity".](/assets/images/Screenshot_Liv_to_Mukta_anon.jpg)  

![Screenshot of my messages to Liv. I replies to their comment: 1. "thanks for highlighting, I read all just now" 2. "I think you're right they should have given context and or content warning, and i understand you being extremely upset" 3. "they actually told me about this as well so they are going to (without me telling) to be better about content warnings!" 4. "I think you posting their account which is the only way they have found some community, and material support, is going to hurt them in both of these ways. it's your choice to post it and you probably don't need me to tell you the above but I think it's a bit like you wanting to punish them?"](/assets/images/Screenshot_me_to_Liv_anon.jpg)  

I did also send another message that's like "I'm going to sleep now so I may reply late" in the same day, and a few days later another message asking if Liv still wants to talk. I don't know when I was blocked so I don't know if they saw those messages.
