As someone who's gradually "gotten into" practicing mutual aid (MA), and have been observing the scene as I go, I want to anwser some common questions that I have heard from people who are new or curious, and share some thoughts.

First of the first: this is not for people who are skeptical about mutural aid. That's not who I want to talk to in this moment and I don't want to drag it even longer than it already is...

Most of the points I'm gonna make is based on the work of other people, including [@geddit.here](https://www.instagram.com/geddit.here) - local MA organiser, [this post](https://www.instagram.com/p/COxdNDepjQp/) ("How to budget sustainably for mutual aid") by @PocketChangePools, [this post](https://www.instagram.com/p/C8aRvCev522/) ("Have fundraiser overload?") by @pqdj_archive, and [this post](https://www.instagram.com/p/C0SjAE0yXJu/) ("Mutual aid thoughts rn") by Hana. This is not an exclusive list. If you find this topic important or interesting I recommend checking them out (I have a highlight for all 3 posts!). I first learned from these sources and found them to be true through my own practice, so I'm gonna write them in my own words, and organise everything into one place. I hope the long format enables more nuances and details which can sometimes be missing from Instagram infographics or scattered between posts and comments.

Let me speak a bit more about the **length** of this article - people are NOT reading long things nowadays, me included! Check the suggested reading time on top, and if you don't have time right now or can't be bothered to read all this, the above posts should really give you most of the same information. But I do hope you can read this! Challenge the control social media has on your attention span! And let me know if you have any ideas to make long content more accessible.

Now let's dive in!


### The introduction

When people need help, what happens? State and carceral "assistance" is fucked, NGOs and orgs funded by govt is fucked and/or overwhelmed, and the amount of people needing support but going without is growing and will continute to grow, because everything is going to shit, and we are increasingly tired and isolated - systems working as intended. I'm not gonna spend time here to prove these points.  

Many of us got radicalised because something happened to us, or someone close to us. It's not the only way but it's a fact I think. So we are easily receptive to the **idea** of mutual aid, because we realise first hand how critical it is, or we wish we could have that support when we needed/need it, or we have received support before and want to give back.  
But regardless if you have these backgrounds or not, you may be interested in mutual aid but find many barriers to actually join the movement/community and put it into action.  

In addition, a lot of us suddenly got exposed to mutual aid because of the slaughter in Gaza, Palestine that escalated greatly after October 2023, and Palestinians calling on the world to help them. It may seem like an "extreme" thing only for the most critical circumstances. In this blog post I hope to address MA from a combined perspective - both for extremely large, devestating and acute crises, and for slow, perhaps small, ongoing community building.  

MA is still only practiced (consistent-ish-ly) by a relatively small number of people, and by people who are mostly not extra well resourced. You don't need to spend a long time in the community to see that people with the least really give the most. To truly build an alternative system of care and support people can rely on, we need more people to become consistent, and we especially need the middle and middle upper class to come on board.  
I really hope after reading this Q&A, you can take away something useful and either start or improve your mutual aid practive.

You might notice I haven't even explained what "mutural aid" is... that will be slowly answered in the questions!  

Let's begin!


### I don't have anything (more) to give...

This is a really really common question to come up, usually with a sense of hopelessness. I think it's commonly seen in people who are more new or outside of the movement looking in, but no one is immune to getting down because of this question.

I want to address a few things: 1. the reality that a lot of us want to give but really can't, or can't give more than what we already do, how to deal with that mentally; 2. the fact that we don't know what else to do other than donating money; and 3. ongoing mutual aid practice is not an individual thing, you need community support too. As well as: 4. the fact that some people under-estimate their capacity for giving, both monetary and otherwise.  

First of all, point 1.  

It's so valid to not be in a position to give, Heck, you probably could use some mutual aid yourself!  
Feeling guilty and trapped when you have nothing to give is not an individual problem; care has been structually stripped away - this includes giving everyone crumbs and having most people fight to a degree for survival, and if you move past survival, you have to consider first and foremost "security", keeping yourself in that place, no matter the cost. This material reality combined with social conditioning is hard to <>, but we must dream on, even if what you can do right now is just dreaming.  

There is no need to give outside of your capacity. Mutual aid is not meant to leave anyone without. If the mean voice in your head ever says that you're selfish or a bad person for not giving more, think about people who make more than you, people who have generational wealth or rich connections, corporation upper managerment, property investors.... It's not all on you!  
I'm going to reference the math in [this post](https://www.instagram.com/p/COxdNDepjQp/) ("How to budget sustainably for mutual aid"): When someone earns 30k a year and give 10$ a week, this is 1.73% of their income. For someone who makes 70k a year, 20$ per week would be 1.48%. For someone on 500k a year, 100$ per week is only 1.04%. If you are the person on 30k or less, and people on 100k+ are not doing their part, is it something **you** can make up for? We want to point <> to the system, not you.  
This is one reason budgeting can be so helpful and lighten a lot of mental and emotional load. If you are clear on what you can realistically give at and time and the reason behind that decision, you don't need to <> **each time** you see a mutual aid call out. I'll talk more about budgeting later.  

I hope you are able to hold the contradiction that, there are so much suffering and so little support to go around and we are here because we want none of that - we want to end it completely - and, we need to do it in a way that is sustainable, however that looks like to each person; AND, we need to grow the movement in many different ways, within ourself and outside.  
The contradiction that a lot more people are suffering losses and pain we cannot even imagine, and, our own limitations and struggles are valid and they can't be just willed away either.  
The contradiction that we (most people reading this but not all) are located in the empires, we have the most comfort, and we need to escalate, we need to constantly exanmine places we can expand our capacity, watch out for complacency, and, we need to slowly build the support that will enable the level of escalation we ultimately want/need, and doing both enables each other to progress, not one can preceed the other.   

Also, your ability to give to mutual aid, or do liberation/community work, is never an indicator of your worth, just like productivity is not an indicator of your worth.  
Giving from a place of shame or guilt is not going to be sustainable.  
The culture of activism is not immune to toxicity, and if not careful we can replicate the structures we want to take down in a different look. To dismantle capitalist and colonial culture, we need to dismantle the perfectionism, the all-or-nothing thinking within ourselves, and dismantle the manifestations of these harmful ideas in our spaces. I want us all to be mindful of this when reading this post and when doing your work.

These are related to a lot of inner work we have to do when we move across fundamentally different systems, it's not quick or easy, so come back to this whenever you need to, it's gonna be a journey.

Now point 2.

Inspired by community sharing about class and privilige facilitated by [Nevo](), let's talk about mutual aid beyong money.

A lot of us don't have spare cash, but still want to help. That's really commendable. I can show you some examples, and you can run wild and dream up of even more innovative ways to contribute. Do you have spare furniture? A functioning old phone? Someone may need that. Do you drive and have time to deliver stuff to people? Are you good at natigating hard rubbish or facebook marketplace?  

We can move further and dream wilder, let's talk about non-material ways to help. A huge need for mutural aid is the sharing, the "getting information to people".

### How do I figure out a plan/budget?

If you have never donated to mutual aid before, or have only been donating sporadically, this section is for you. A plan, a budget, a system that is aimed at consistency(ish) will make things so much easier, and the earlier you have one the better. 

It may fee like extra work, but having a plan helps with decision fatigue, forgetfulness, and reduces negative rumination (thinking over and over if you made the right call regarding a particular fundraiser) if you are prone to that kind of thing. Mutual aid is not going anywhere anytime soon, so you might as well make thing earies early on.

A plan can be very simple, and can be changed and expanded at any time you want. You can start with "5 dollars a week", see how you go, and adjust from there.

A couple of factors each person need to consider in forming their plan/budget/system:
- The (total) amount. Do you have a stable income? How much do you make? How much do you spend on non-essentials if any? Can you cut that back if it means you can help a community member secure a roof over their head, or a First Nations person improve their quality of life/recover from incarceration by the racist illegitimate state, or a Palestinian buy water, food or register to escape the bombing?
  - The definition of "non-essentials" can vary from person to person. It is not really other people's place to tell you what you should cut back.
- The distribution: Do you want to give bigger amounts to less fundraisers or smaller amounts to more fundraisers? Usually organisers recommend the latter, but it's up to you.
- The frequency. Would you donate 1 dollar daily (there are indeed people needing help daily), or would you donate 5 times on pay day?
- Do you want to set up recurring payments for set people/organisers? Or do you want to choose who to support with more flexibility? Combination of both?
The posts I linked to talks about these in more details. 

I do want to take this opportunity to encourage people to dig deep. Have a look in your banking app, go through what you spent on, maybe try to think, if I didn't do this, am I ok with that?  
At the same time, you can build up your capacity over time. There is no shame in starting with 1 dollar, and working your way up, if that makes you more comfortable. Anything is better than nothing (This picture feels appropriate here: ![2 cakes]())

I also want to quickly address the word "consistency". It doesn't mean strickly 100% of the time, it just means a stable trend and a commitment.


### I don't have anyone to share MA to...


### How do I know who to trust? I don't know the recipients

In a capitalistic, scarecity-based society, it makes sense that we worry about the idea of giving *money* away, often to a stranger in the context of MA. You face the choice of spending the money on yourself or people you know, and see or feel the effect, or sending it into the void, without feeling its benefits or seeing the result(*). That goes against everything we've been taught and I want to acknowledge it's hard to unlearn.  

One big difference of MA and donating to a "trusted" charity NGO is, you can actually get to know the recipient and/or the organiser personally. This way, you can "confirm" their situation and know where your money is going. But this goes beyong "verification" and I'll expand on it in the next point.  
I don't judge people who need to see proof, but "getting to know the person" goes beyong just asking for proof. Asking for proof can be very transactional, and doesn't help you build community at all.  
Asking people in deep trouble to prove they in fact are in need is not something I like to do, and I usually don't question anything unless things actually start to look suspicious. 

Also, I don't know if this is a cross culture thing, but I used to always give beggars some change as a kid, until my ma considered me old enough to learn the cold hard truth that "they're not actually desparately in need, they're usually faking (making them a scammer) and actually make a lot more money than you think". Sometimes such a "scammer organisation" even gets exposed in the news. 
And sure, scammers exist. Some people using the genocide to make fake gofundmes have already been exposed. So I 


### Other reasons to get to know the mutual aid recipient?

There are so many reasons to get to know the recipient personally.

Mutual aid is community building. This doesn mean we have a group of people willing to give out donations and another group of people who will then take those donations. "Mutual" in the nema means this is for each other. If we still use the charity mindset of "helper vs receiver", the thing becomes transactional and conmunity is NOT strengthened.
You may also be surprised at how many people once recieved mutual aid, and soon will give back to mutual aid.

People who are stuck in bad situations, people who are multiple marginalised, are often on the receiving end of mutual aid, and MA call outs are often directed at people with more resources. In antiracism we say we need to listen to racialised people. In class awareness building we say we need to listen to poor people. In prison abolition work we need to listen to formerlly incarcerated people. In disability advocacy we say we need to listen to disabled people... Do you see what I'm seeing? The mutual aid recipients have so much to teach us.

One reason people shy away from doing that is it can feel like an emotional burden to take on, when you're not sure you are availabele for them. But that is the charity mindset talking - you are assuming that if you talk to them, you need to "take care of them" emotionally. I'm telling you now, that you don't need to do that anymore than you would to a normal(?) friend. 


### I have (some priviliges) but I'm also dealing with a lot right now, what is the right thing to do?

I hope reading the above questions already answers this question in part.  

I don't know what kind of people in today's economy will truly feel like they have no risks or financial issues in their life. Probably just the 1%?

No one can exactly tell you what's the right thing to do for an exact situation. No one can really tell you how you do mutual aid is wrong either. People can tell you what they think you should or shouldn't do, but you are still free to do and justify however you want.  


### MA doesn't feel like a priority for me, I already do other liberation work and have no more extra to give.

Short anwser to this question: That's fine!  

Slightly longer anwser: You can do anything, because you are the expert of your own life and actions. Things are not fixed, so as long as you continue to grow and adapt your work, and keep it real, it's fine!  

I also want to suggest, if this question comes up for you, take a moment to breathe, and think about why is this question arising? Did you read someone's plea for donations and because of that feeling guilty & a need to defend your boundaries? Did you hear something MA organisers say and felt personally attacked? If so, realease that with the next breath~  
Discernment is really important and we need to know what applies to us, what's speaking to us and what's not - the thing is not necesarily wrong or off, it's just for someone else. If we exist in the space of liberation work without proper discernment, it can create unnessicary tension for other people and ourselves, and <ease, release>.  
This doesn't mean I have given people a pass to bypass *any* critisism - again balance and nuance is needed, but personally I believe at the end of the day people are expert of themselves <33 And claiming otherwise really doesn't help with things at the end of the day.  


### I don't feel like "comitting" myself to mutual aid?

When mutual aid organisers call for consistent efforts, that's absolutely true. Mutual aid is building community not charity, so it needs to be dependable, and the best way to make it dependable is people who contribute do it as consistently as possible.  

But if you feel like once you start, you would "have" to "keep up" or else you're "flaky" or "inconsistent" or "unserious"...



### What are some best practices for sharing a mutual aid campaign?

This is gonna depend on the person and how your circle interacts with things etc, but here are some general tips for a start. Implement based on your spoons level! No need to feel bad if you can't always be on top of it.

- Share with the donation link - Paypal, GFM, Kofi etc  
  - If not, make it very clear where the link can be found. Unfortunately, the more steps it takes to get to the donation portal whatever that is, the more likely you will lose out on contributions. This is not necessarily because people are "lazy" or attention span, many things can happen. It's just good practice to make things as easy and inviting as possible.  
- If it's a bank transfer, make sure the bank details are visible on the same page (eg. when sharing an Instagram post to your stories, screenshot the bank details and add it if it's not in the post)
- Give some updates or backgrounds in your own words, this makes requests feel more personal and less like just a transaction  
- Or talk about how even a small donation can make a difference or other basic MA educational information. Even if someone may not donate, that information may take them a step closer for next time.


### I want to help someone fundraise, what should I know?

I'll just share what I have observed/learned from doing, this is not exaustive at all, and actually you will learn so much once you start!!

So the first point is don't worry too much and just start. 

### Conclusion

Wowwwww that was a lot of information. If you actually read all of it, well done. If you read all of it but found out you actually knew all of it already, I'm not sorry :p  

Feel free to reach out (bottom of page) to discuss anything!!  

Until next time <3
