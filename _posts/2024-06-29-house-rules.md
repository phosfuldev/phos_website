I would like to explicitly state my social/parasocial boundaries and how I would like people to interact with me on this website & online in general! Figured this is good to establish now rather than later out of nessetiry if something happens lol.

1. **My goal is for my writings to never be directed at one person/be a personal attack.**  
I wish when you interact with my writing you can keep this in mind, even when it feels pointed at you. A lot of times I write because of a thing I see (an event or an opinion), but I do try to connect it to broader issues and make it so anyone can take something away. I can't predict how each person would see/interpret the posts so I can't keep everyone's possible reaction in mind, although I try out of habit, so this is also a reminder for myself to release that xx.  

One thing I saw and really like is, "treat people like we depend on each other". I'm still learning this too.

2. **Always apply critical thinking with what you read here and examine if it intergrates well into the fundamental abolitionist, decolonial frameworks.**  
I write about topics that I'm not an "expert" on. I haven't worked in the field or studied for years and years. By still choosing to write, I hope to stimulate dialog and create a learning space for everyone. Which is why you should be critical of my words and opinions.  
If someone who knows more/differently come across my writings, I hope we can talk about our differences, and maybe learn something.  
I can hurt people when I say things that I don't understand fully/well/from all perspectives. I acknowledge that and my intention is I will do my best to not let that happen. I welcome feedback if/when that happens.

3. **Constructive criticism is welcomed**  
Hell, any critisism is welcomed, as long as the intention is open conversation and improvement. I'll hopefully be able to take what I can take from it and leave the rest, although I do hope the person who's giving me criticism can refrain from reactivity.  
I really try to interrogate the "policing" dynamics in interpersonal spaces. What are "constructive"? What are "mean"? What are "yeah but you should have said it better/differently"? What is "policing" and when are we "policing" others when we tell them to "don't police"? Maybe I'll write about this some day. I'm kind of obsessed with language and words.  

4. Please share my writings with credit if you are going to. Attributing to "Phos", and link it to my website or my [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/phomnomnom/) is the best way for now. This may be updated in future.

5. I don't care about grammar! There will be grammar mistakes. And I will certainly use slangs, meme speak and brain rot speak. I'd like to know if something is causing confusion on meaning but other than that I don't care!

That is all, I appreciate you reading these! I don't really know how realistic it is to expect people to read all this so any feedback to make them more accessible is welcome!

(Now, because how the website is generated, the below link is under every "post", it's a bit awkward but I can't do anything!! for now. pls ignore)
