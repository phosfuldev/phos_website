I would like to explicitly state my social/parasocial boundaries and how I would like people to interact with me on this website & online in general! Figured this is good to establish now rather than later out of nessetiry if something happens lol.

1. **My goal is for my writings to never be directed at one person/be a personal attack.**  
I wish when you interact with my writing you can keep this in mind, even when it feels pointed. I do sometimes write because of a thing I see/experience (an event or an opinion), but I do try to connect it to broader issues & themes and try to make it so anyone can take something away. I can't predict how each person would see/interpret the posts so I can't keep everyone's possible reaction in mind, although I try out of habit, so this is also a reminder for myself to release that.  

One thing I saw and really like is, "treat people like we depend on each other". I'm still learning this too.

2. **Always apply critical thinking with what you read here and examine if it intergrates well into the fundamental abolitionist, decolonial frameworks.**  
I'm not an expert on anything, I write to share what I think are potentially worth sharing. By still choosing to write publicly, I hope to stimulate dialog and create a learning space for everyone. Which is why you should be critical of my words and opinions.  
If someone who knows more/differently come across my writings, I hope we can talk about our differences.  
I am open to feedback if/when I hurt someone with my words.

3. **Constructive criticism is welcomed**  
Hell, any critisism is welcomed, as long as the intention is open conversation and improvement. I'll hopefully be able to take what I can take from it and leave the rest, although I do hope to be treated with respect as much as possible.  
I ackowledge that sometimes learning and intergrating new understanding takes time, so when I'm not able to hear what someone says, I will remind myself to take a step back.

4. Please share my writings with credit if you are going to. Attributing to "Phos", and link it to my website or my [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/phomnomnom/) is the best way for now. This may be updated in future.

That is all, I appreciate you reading these! I don't really know how realistic it is to expect people to read all this so any feedback to make them more accessible is welcome!

(Now, because how the website is generated, the below link is under every "post", it's a bit awkward but I can't do anything!! for now. pls ignore)
