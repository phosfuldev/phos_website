  - I would like to elaborate on this later in the post, because I had an interesting discussion recently.


#### (Psych worker) being "mentalli ill" aka mad themselves but against abolition?

Sometimes you will see discussions in community like, "I prefer being referred to as 'having autism' instead of 'being autistic'." "People with depression have brain chemical imbalences, that's why we (are like xyz or do xyz), we don't have control over it." There are people who seem to want to preserve the pathologising model and deficiency based psychology. I don't doubt there are psych workers like this too because well, no reason there's not.

As I said before, we don't wan to "impose" views on people or punish people who "don't agree". I do think I/we still need to sincerely examine this experience rather than just conveniently exclude it. Since we boast trusting lived experience, we shouldn't invalidate people because their experience or point of view is different. Although I do not want to make this into a both-sides thing. So Let's see how I go.

I do want to first talk about the language of "being imposed". Where else do we hear about this? When conservatives are against queer people and drag. When liberals are confronted that voting isn't gonna "save democracy". When Palestinians say resistance is a right. When high risk and covid conscious people ask for covid safety measures. When less margenalised people refuse to take on feedback of more/multiple margenalised people.  
(* I don't actually like calling people "conservatives" or "liberals", but for brievity it'll do for now)  
Usually the more privilidged feels like their "freedom of opinions" is being restricted.  
It's "being imposed an opinion/view" because it's only that, the opinion/view. Not your safety being threatened. Not material losses. Not ongoing silencing and invisibility. It's basically just finally your perspective being challenged.  
This may not be 100% what's happening 100% of the time (that's not a thing I don't think), but I think it's important to check yourselves.  
It may be hard to draw a line in what's bad communication (not feeling heard/not hearing another perspective) vs what's a bad take (self vitmising). But it's important to note it's not just the former, the latter definitely happens. 

Now I'll continue with my analysis on the phenomenon. I'm going to speak broadly, some or all or non may apply to any particular peoson.

There could be internalised ableism and other internalised -isms at play. When someone train to become a psych worker, they are not trained neutrally. The training is naturally aligned with the system. If your first contact of the concept of "mandatory reporting" is "it's something to keep both parties safe and out of trouble", the anchor effect will make you more likely to believe so, and if you hear that it's actually often harmful, less likely to believe this opposing perspective. 

Especially if the later opposing perspective doesn't come from an authority - this is another thing psych training can subconsciously teach someone. For something to even be considered, it needs to come from a place of authority. This is not just taught, but also implied in every step of the training.
