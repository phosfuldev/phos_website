#### What happened 

I screenshoted Alana's repost of what Keiran said about getting prepared and survival skills, and vaguely said "this is a weird take" etc. Alana reached out about it and we talked a little bit. At the time I responded to/talked with Alana, I didn't understand the core of the issue so I responded unreasonably.
(saying the fact that I was responding to Alana's repost is just to be clear, but I still understand my behaviour had the most impact to Keiran and Mob and that's the important part)


#### My apology & self analysis

##### The basics

I shouldn't have casually and vaguely "critiqued"/criticised a Blak person/their views on my stories, and I apologise for that. No matter what my exact intentions were at the time of posting, it was another case of settler's recurring/ongoing attempt to wear out Mob and discredit their efforts. My lack of consideration and my inability to see the issue at the time showed deeply ingrained racism and lack of respect towards Mob. 


##### Bad faith, double standards & context collapse

I saw what Keiran said and I jumped to conclusions. Just from this snippet of text, or even combined with the little I know about them, I shuoldn't have judged Keiran or Alana to be ableist so quickly. 

I do think ableism and sanism is widespread (both in general and in "left" spaces) and we should be more aware and talk about it. But this was not the place, and what Keiran said can only be seen as related through specific interpretations. At the very least, I should have asked for clarification with curiosity. In that way, I could have a chance(*) to actually understand all the relevant context. Even if I had just taken a pause before posting my reaction (yes, it wasn't really a critique but just a reaction), I may realise how much I was missing/misunderstanding, and maybe I would've shut up.

I applied a double standard here, I felt like since Kieran didn't make 100% clear what he meant, I could chime in with my interpretation like it was the "truth", like I know what was going on in his head. But when what I said was treated like that, of course I was unhappy! I wanted *my* intentions to be read as benign but I didn't treat what Keiran said with the same attitude. I apologise for this and will strive to be more self aware.  

I have also been hypocritical towards Alana's story post about myself in the same way. I initially thought, I was just casually mentioning it, externalising my thoughts as they come just like I always do, but their post was more like an intentional, serious attack. But I can see now, if the roles reversed, my stories would be felt in the exact same way. 

I always talked about treating each other with kindness and curiosity, the need to build real relationships despite trauma and online algorithms, but I still have a long way to go. A lot of us are tense in this time, it feels like too much is at stake, and too little progress is happening. This isn't to excuse what I did, but instead I want to say, learn from this example. even if we are tense, we still need to treat each other like how we want to be treated. like we depend on each other. Otherwise, we'll just start more trauma.


##### Survival skills

Of course, it's not Mob's responsibility to make sure settlers have adequate skills. Actually, Keiran and [BPU](https://www.blackpeoplesunion.org/) has worked hard to put together resources to educate us. Keiran isn’t saying “get prepared” out of individualism and elitism and that is clear through what he does for the community, and the context of Indigenous resistance.

Since settlers benefit unfairly from colonialism and caused/are still causing Blak people’s suffering, we have a responsibility to support Indigenous-led resistance, uplift Blak people from systematic oppression and make their survival easier. Not the other way around.

I knew these ideas but as you can see, I didn’t fully understand and embody it. If I saw that story and asked: “hey, these are my skills, how should I share them in a way accessible to both me and others, so the community survive better?” This conversation would probably be more productive.


##### My lack of relationships with Mob

I have not been proactive about forming relationships and working with local Mob whose land I'm on, and that's on me. It's certainly not on Mob to make me comfortable enough to reach out, but I always have a responsibility to do so as long as I live on this stolen land and benefit from genocide as a settler. I admit I’m uncomfortable about it in part because of being a settler and afraid of doing something wrong, and I need to work on this, including building up basic understanding and history knowledge, so that I am more safe to be around. I think I would also be more comfortable if I feel more secure in having a shared understanding.


##### My social media behaviour

I also want to acknowledge, over time on Instagram, I have been messaging people "unprompted" under their stories to share my thoughts, many times in disagreement or partial disagreement. I apologise for the hurt this has caused. I have started to reflect about this since I saw someone point it out recently, before this incident, but I'm just gonna make it clear that I should seriously start implementing communication techniques that I already know (and didn’t use), like checking if people want to hear any feedback first before expressing it.


#### The end

Thanks to a few friends who gently held me accountable and talked through the problems with me. Your time, patience and understanding is greatly appreciated.  
I thank Alana for first bringing up the issue with me. 

If you have any thoughts you want to share about this, I welcome them. If from reading this you still see issues on something, please let me know. Any corrections/additions will be in caption or comments.
