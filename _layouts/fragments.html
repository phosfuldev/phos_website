  <h1>fragments</h1>
  <p>This is where I put the thoughts that are not fully formed into an article yet. 
     I may flesh some of them out, I may not. If you feel called to write about any of these, feel free to.</p>
  
  <p>Currently moving pieces of thoughts from my Instagram stories to here! Very slow process and right now 0 filtering or search functionalities...</p>
