#### autistic community

These people are not necessarily including decolonisation and liberatory values in their content (the ones that do are in corresponding above lists), some of them even never mention anything "political", so be careful. But their content can still be helpful in other ways, especially if you are new to the journey of discovering you may be neurodivergent.
