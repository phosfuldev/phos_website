#### liberatory mental health care:

This list technically should also contain the people above (this is like the bigger circle and the above is a smaller circle, that's how it is in my head). This list is people who don't specifically talk about Mad Liberation or abolition but is otherwise well informed and liberatory.

#### autistic community:

These people are not necessarily including decolonisation and liberatory values in their content (the ones that do are in corresponding above lists), some of them even never mention anything "political", so be careful. But their content can still be helpful in other ways, especially if you are new to the journey of discovering you may be neurodivergent.
