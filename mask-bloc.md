#### What are mask blocs

A mask bloc is a local community organisation that provides masks to people who needs them. Some mask blocs also provide other related items. This is usually in the context of covid/airborne diseases prevention so the masks need to be high quality, such as N95s. (There has been conflicting information on KN95s and KF94s, as of now the bloc is still providing them to use in low(er) risk situations)

The main purpose of mask blocs is to improve accessibility of masks and covid prevention/care items to the community. Many blocs also make educational materials for both online and irl distribution.

#### This mask bloc

I started this bloc in Feb 2024, inspired by & with encouragement from the (then also new) @covidsafetyblocnorth. They're not active for now but I will always appreciate the help I got from them!

This project is funded by me and community donations of spare masks.

We have a [google form](https://forms.gle/HmuXZJYTerbD6cCfA) for requesting items, and inventory is updated on the [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/maskbloc.melb.se). **As of June 2024 an update is needed but not yet published as I deal with some life stuff.**  

On rare occasions we have gotten monetary donations. I still don't wish to call for $$ donations for the bloc though as I think there are more urgent places to doante money to, like directly to Palestinianss/Gaza aid projects, Sudan, other places currently expericing crisis, First Nations folks on this continent, and more - see [resources]() section of this website for some of those.


#### Collaborate!

If you want to work together on something you think the bloc/I can contribute to, [DM](https://www.instagram.com/maskbloc.melb.se) or [email](mailto:maskbloc.melb.se@gmail.com) the bloc.

If you want to help out - donate masks or volunteer, pls also get in touch!

I'm also happy to anwser any questions if you are thinking about setting up your own bloc.
