    body: people trying to leave meta and organising /talking among themselves to go to whichever platform is highlighting one thing for me... there are many little groups of mutual aid or organising. I don't know how much these little groups communicate, as I'm actually kinda new to joining other groups (social stuff is weird and scary) but maybe, we should talk. have a "representative meeting" even. that sounds corporate and horrible but I think we need to coordinate more

      "mutual aid" can only go so far if we're not actually connecting with people, and build robust relationships and networks (I'm imagining something like a safety net rather than linkedin network you get me). like actual relationship based on personhood and care. not just political work, life work. and I also think, is this ever gonna work on a big enough scale? or, do we just all have to do this, and have thousands of these small care networks, which can also be coordinated when needed?? damn, I foresee so much people trauma and yt bs

    body: nothing will ever be good again because unless I return home but as an outsider, a "tourist", a stranger, never really needing my home to be a home again, I can not return. I have lost my home. I was always meant to lose my home. my home kicked me out is probably nore accurate. I have no home and everything else I see is just a replacement and I will always be aware of that. maybe one day I'll be able to make peace with this...

    body: I really feel the disconnect from my generation, and other recent generations, to our elders. a loooot of us. we don't know how to speak with each other. the rapid 'progression", or at least change, in society, including the whole moral and value system, broke us apart, while lingering old structures still making us perform a certain appearance in some areas. my parents always tell me we are too different, there are a lot of things we just can't make them understand, and we just need to act like what they want to see. But, I want to really reach out to them. I want to understand what I didn't try to find out. what could they be like as a real person? what's their experiences of their time? what do they conclude from it, what kind of person it made them? do they want to know anything from me? There will be challenges, and my parents will be right in some ways, but I hope not completely. We need generational connection as a species. Sometimes the elders also just want to preserve what they can in a structure that make them suffer first and finally gave them power. I don't know how each person would act. But I also want to just treat them like people.

    body: Right now, the conditions for "mutual aid replacing capitalism" to even *begin* to develop, is not there. Even "mutual aid to lessen our dependence on capitalism" is not really possible. I wonder if we can create the right conditions by educating, organising, or, if we also have to wait for society to get to a certain state, and people will literally see and feel the need for it in their everyday. I'm not sure if fundraising, or say what I'm doing now, even is moving us closer to this, or not, or on a significant level or not. Something needs to change.

      suggestion that yall may not have a chance to use but can pass on as from a Chinese person! 
      When u make a video on social media, that involves you saying a Chinese name or place name or even just a word, aside from trying to pronounce it (and probably getting it wrong in most cases, which is fine lol western languages and sounds vs chinese is very different, it actually makes more sense that you can't say it right if you haven't studied the language in general, and the struggle is funny. saying something badly and knowing it is not offensive, what is offensive is decided by a lot of context and not only a bad pronounciation. pls don't stress yourself on a perfect pronounciation! anyway) 
      - aside from trying to pronounce it AND putting on a caption that spells it in Latin letters, because captions are important - *try also adding the Chinese characters on screen*, when possible. 
      As a Chinese person, in most cases I cannot understand a very westernised pronunciation haha (if your pronounciation is good, you know it and this doesn't apply to you), especially when it's said quickly in passing, AND I'm not used to seeing something Chinese in Latin letters. BUT, I can quickly recognise what you're talking about and follow what you're saying as a whole, if the characters are on screen. even if you don't know which to use - traditional or simplified, use whichever you can! it's still easier than deciphering the Latin letters. Or even both! 
      Other languages that doesn't use latin characters would also benefit from this I think!

      I need to do hard things, I need to be committed to my healing and rehabilitation. yes, everything wants to work against that. yes it's hard. and even "healing" is so often a disguise to get you well enough and normal enough to keep it all going. but i can be a garden weed* that just wants to live, and still strives to live, despite everything. it's the only way. this has to come even after recognising it's hard, I don't deserve this etc. not to say "it's easy actually". it IS hard. and to live I still need to do this. 
      *"garden weed" is kind of a colonial, human centred concept, but I'm more referring to this concept in Chinese called ÈáéËçâ. I don't know if there's a equal translation

    body: (responding to a post that talks about community building) I'm just wondering how does this translate? and even what do I want it to "translate" to?? even tho l've only been here for a few years, I know so often "community" can just break apart one day. this usually means some fundamental work hasn't been done. either part of the community (usually the already more structually oppressed people) felt used, unheard, or harmed constantly, or conflict happen and no one knows how to handle it properly (who does the conflict harm also ties into point 1). this is also because right now, the community we have is just a group of people that you can decide to not see anymore one day, if you don't want to be accountable, if you don't want to put in the work that's asked etc. we do not have a communal way of life. we don't have the commitment. maybe if we start treating literally Each relationship like community building... bring in the awareness of above and work to prevent it before it happens.. maybe that's how to actually build community? but both sides needs to do it. just getting people together and doing stuff surely isn't enough.

    body: so, about VPN in china. there are a few factors. the management/crackdown is periodic. both on important dates in a year, and over years. some years may be tighter and some years may be less. it may be in response to certain events. I vaguely remember people got in trouble with the police in one period, but I honestly don't remember the details, if they were fined, detained, or what, even what did they do, just browsing YouTube or something specific ("something specific" can still be fabricated/redefined) but my conclusion is this doesn't happen often generally (at least yet) and probably only happens in tighter periods. vpn companies sometimes get shut down. sometimes it is let live for a while. this tells me, the country allows some "illegal internet usage" activities, let it slide. but if you run into a tight period, and if someone have their attention on you (for example because you have been posting "sensitive stuff", or doing certain kinds of organising online, because all social media usage is identity verified and tied to your person) and thinks you cross a line, you *can* get into trouble. this time/right now seems pretty ok but I genuinely don't know, I don't have enough research on this anymore

      I started following this person (*note: in the original story I said who, but not gonna bother here) a while ago, then, they went back to china and started posting a lot more like this (*note: "this" refers to stuff like "this is the real china, stop hating on china and we are actually advanced and care for citizens"). I just want yall to know this content is very rose coloured. Shanghai is one of the biggest and most advanced cities and cannot be used to represent china like this. even tho you may still want to say "well even the biggest city in the us doesn't have that" yeah but I'm not here to say which is better. just want yall to know this view is very limited and biased. from what I can see from following all this time, I think this person is very westernised, up to this point have a life mainly "based" in the us (idk if they will be moving back from now or in future..), and doesn't have deep connections to china's reality (only a distant one). also people who are from big cities naturally have a more privileged background than people in smaller cities and rural areas in many ways. people from the biggest cities also was able to cash in the most on the past ~50 years of rapid development. and, people who chose to move to the us in the more recent times, are generally privileged (eg. has the money to go study, or access to education/job that facilitates it). by privileged, I mean they don't naturally have an understanding how life is for more ordinary and oppressed people. so their talk about "china", is likely naturally lacking unless they really learned what it's like for the people. your life is also easier in china if you like the communist party of course, and you're able to justify what they do to yourself. I do not and cannot. I really didn't like the way their content lacked nuance and the way "communists" in the west would rally behind this kind of obviously one sided content without second thought. the fact that this content is popular, it's like people don't want to actually think. 
      another thing to note is, they as someone who has a western life, education, platform, and "chose" to "visit" china (instead of like, visa expired, deported), this person going back and saying stuff like "look how good china is (as a visitor)" "this food is only $2 USD", how is it different from a westerner doing it? I freaking hate translating local prices to USD... and them being a "communist"... it's giving "your favourite token poc"
      altho, on a more personal level, seeing their content also made me rethink, and slightly change some of my biases on china myself. yes, public infrastructure, including trains, roads, parks/ vegetation, nowadays can already be said to be better than the west, especially in medium to big cities. culture is starting to be celebrated and preserved on an upward trend, although not without problems. community service is improving, altho nowhere near good enough (and I think, they just want to do whatever without considering peoples actual needs yk) somethings are good

      (note: below is my opinion, and an ongoing discussion that should centre people who has been labeled with personality disorders/NPD, and the most oppressed/harmed.) the thing about calling white, colonial culture "narssisist"... I totally get what you mean. self centred, self important, lack of empathy*, doesn't mind being violent/hurtful, their version of reality is the correct one, can't stand being challenged, can be your saviour but can't actually collaborate with you etc... but you can't take the word "narssisist" out of the psychiatry, diagnosis context. it's impossible. you can't just declare "this word is not this anymore". language does work like that and can't be changed like that. the fact that you don't think the psych background and its history is relevant here just shows, you are not involved with/organising with mad people, and/or lack of understanding, and an opportunity to learn.
      especially, we can't label *people* like this... it has never gone well and always end up actually hurting us.

    body: I am also reflecting on my messaging. I'm rarely "mean" on the other account, which I think is fine to keep like that. I know shaming can lead to freeze. I know hope moves people to act. so that's why I roll like that. but if someone is okay with being a part of this only when I'm mainly nice, but have a problem with the one time I'm not "nice enough", they don't see me as a person, and they don't actually see this work as mutual aid. those people can leave. what I AM concerned with is the increasing Detachment. people view stuff and don't take action. help is less and less, each one of us is running our own (1 or 2 or 3) campaigns so we each ask others to share Ours and can't share in return because ~the algorithm~ punishes us for sharing "too much". I wouldn't say there are less people wanting to help, but we are all poorer, and new people joining in on sharing doesn't work as well as before. I have shit reach but I've been having shit reach for all this time and it was better before. what is it??

    body: an interesting phenomenon. some white people have directly reached out to me for help with fundraising, and barely any people of colour have. (there's been 2 I can remember, and only 1 from the MA account) this could have a few reasons/factors. 1. they picked up I haven't post many campaigns for POC (a unspoken rule; when the post doesn't mention, assume white). 2. white people are more comfortable to ask for help from "strangers"/someone they don't know personally and haven't personally trusted, it's harder for POC to trust a stranger to share vulnerable details in the asking for help process. 3. white people, compared to POC, feel more comfortable to "ask for help"/show that you need help, especially to someone you don't know 4. POC are more supported by family and extended family more than white people on average (someone else brought up this point) 5. white people have more time and energy to ask for help. what do you think? (*later someone also suggested I can make fundraising for POC an explitic priority of the page. Will do when I'm able)

I'm telling you small actions you can do, why are you not doing them? nervous system doesn't let you? so... now what? I know I should provide space and understanding, but sometimes that doesn't move them from inaction to action. maybe, likely, they need more time. I understand how hard it is to "rewire" a thought pattern. and they didn't want to do this, it's the same fucked up world that made them like this. but knowing all this, I still find it hard to talk to people like this as a person. which is why I keep also fucking up the above. ifl was ever in a "counselling" position, and don't know the person, well, personally, would I be able to do differently? if so, will I be able to "achieve the aim" and have one more comrade fighting alongside us? is it wrong to have a goal when talking to people?

    body: ("responding" to a event's covid notes) power holders (wether we talk about situational or constant privilege-power) always do this. inch as slowly towards progress as possible. just because they don't want to or it's hard. this exact action puts people at risk. individuals making changes in their life sometimes needs to go slowly for many reasons, like from not wearing masks at all, to wearing them in doctors office, to hopefully more. understand that. but power holders - you should be the one making sure people are safe when you have a say. you should be doing research (ask someone if you need help) and put forward the best thing you can come up with. you shouldn't leave this to literally the most vulnerable in your audience. hard to put into words. it's not like organising something suddenly makes you have more energy. I understand how burned out and under resourced organisers are. but they should honestly be included in the capacity calculation and if you can't do it, ask for help or change the event so that it's safe AND doable. it's annoying and this is everywhere... the progression is always - this happens. now we keep having to ask for more and eventually it's too much (they were never gonna meet our original demand of real safety) and now we are the bad guys... sometimes we decide you're not worth the effort and the potential conflict/gaslighting and we just leave. another mass movement lesson??

We need that, but don't wait for someone to tell you you fucked up. And if the roles are reversed we don't owe the other side that either. Accountability is truly a gift.

      I do actually feel some kind of way when men and some others (queer folks and women is more case by case) use the word bitch in an insult and it's not really about the identity of the person. I have a problem with people using the word that way in general. But it's especially some kind of way if the person is in any way affiliated or adjacent to the identity and experience of men/masculinity (or in women's case, people who try to get safety etc by become patriarchy's helpers), and or distance from which of women. It makes me think of this quote:/ "sorry to". I'm sorry, if in an attempt to reclaim the word, you probably reinforced how women are so casually dehumanised in the general society and collective consciousness, that women's existence is a criticism anyway. I wish it doesn't work like this too, but it probably continue to be like this because the fundamental reality have not changed, despite a lot of women making progress in the society they're in. And if you were just using the word casually, really think about it more. <br>
      I've been seeing this somewhat regularly in progressive spaces (not a surprise tbh, just look at misogyny in "leftism"). And at the end of the day I don't Get A Say in how other people do things but this is my offering to you.

It seems impossible at each and every step because this is still operating in the same broader system and this system is anti life. <br> the alternative is, I can be (work towards being) an integral part of a community, I am there for everyone, and everyone will be there for me. the basic assumptions are completely different, which "side hustles" etc can never address. it's not about "job satisfaction", or being your own boss and being in full control, or being able to unleash your creativity, or finding your purpose. time to move out of those, we can dream bigger.

    body: I love how we're embracing the weird now. not just on a personal aesthetic and identity level. no no no no. but weird as in refusing to participate in the bloodthirsty systems. weird as in doing our own thing AND creating our own community that can materially support each other - not one without the other. weird as in being our full human self which shed light on abuse and surface our lived wisdoms and let us connect with not just human kin but also non human kin. weird as in radical love and acceptance.

Money that I only want because I need to "pay bills". All made up by a class of people to create scarcity and supress our natural power and agency.

    body: When we just go on and live "normally" we are actually abandoning each other. To stop abandoning and to stop being abandoned we need to act for each other. This is true with protesting our tax money going to the war machine, and true with masking against covid 19. <br> Caring (and doing) feels so difficult and "out of the way" because it isn't programmed into the system like extraction and oppressive hierarchies are. But we have to build the alternative world.

    body: The attitude of "we can agree to disagree" *within* a marginalised community often comes from the same unwillingness to look deeper into WHY you disagree and just want surface peace/lack of obvious tension/conflict, that people can easily call out when it comes from a privilidged group/person onto said community. <br> It's giving privilege, it's giving aligning with the oppressor, it's giving  replicating the structures we claim to be taking down.

    body: I am finding... when we think of our neurodivergent traits or needs as "contradictory"... we are looking at it from a neurotypical perspective already. <br> It is because of the perspective and framing, that things look contradictory. they may not be "inherently contradictory".

    body: I think the expectation we have on ourselves to be completely consistent, and to be completely consistent in "getting better at this" can also come from a place of re-creating harmful hierarchy within ourselves, rather than the genuine(?) need to escalate. It's just like "healing is not linear", just like no to perfectionism (internalised capitalism).

        "What does putting the customer at the centre mean to you?" <br> It means when I'm a customer I'm supposed to be the most superior being because I make the capitalist loop of production complete, because of this I'm almost worshipped and put above other people that has different roles (like the salesperson/customer service, the "workers") at that point of the cycle (because I'm the main component). This is supposed to reward my participation and make me come back for more but it's actually only to distract from the fact that when the circle is complete, when I stop being a customer, I fall back to being the worker and I get friking exploited

    body: I feel some kind of way when popular feminists be like "oh I just don't date men", and usually it's accompanied with a sea of agreement and praise. like I guess you are free to have a personal opinion... but it's not about that it's about how it shapes the space. <br> for many of us, we can only look to an online community of feminists. the loudest voices in the online space matter. when we come across and get into a space hoping to finally make sense of things and be understood, and in some aspects you do feel seen, but then some other aspects is conflicting with your own experience, it can be confusing. especially being a poc and trying to "learn feminism" from white women lol <br> anyway... even "just not dating men/get married" comes with privilge. and remember... privilge doesn't mean you have it easy, it means some hurdles that others have to overcome is not there for you.

    body: AI art rant. I can get it if people have the desire to use it personally, altho I would't follow thru on that desire knowing it'a all stolen and using it just further normalise corporations stealing from us not just art but everything. <br> also, hot take but try to find an artist that can work with you on a small budget or even for free is still better than using AI art. (there's also obviously the choice of not involving an artist and do it yourself) If you reach out to a bunch of people, that's a start of a relationship, that's community building. skill sharing is community building. and we need to be creative about it and create alternative systems that doesn't involve money. <br> and I get that artists are sick of doing free work so this has to be non exploitative. don't just use an artist then discard them. again it's about community. this may all be a lot of work to organise but isn't that exactly the work we are doing?

    body: thinking about all the conversations that went wrong lol. and it usually happens in similar ways. we would say oh its because we are autistic. there's just some NT code  we can't crack. <br> but I see it more and more between autistic/ND people too. (and not excluding the possibility that some of these people are not actually NT and are unidentified ND?) <br> So now I'm more incliend to say the conversations "go wrong" not because some inherent differences of ND and NT people, but it's because of ableism and internalised ableism.

  - tags: []
    date: "2024-06-18"
    body: Let's talk about the casual ableism in calling how ND people speak and interact "rude" "condesending" "arrogant", and refusing to give something you knee-jerk feel like is "rude" some benefit of the doubt... People are not ready to have a nuanced conversation about this. And this is why justice must be intersectional, include interpersonal justice, and people working towards justice all need to do healing work...

    body: Random thought on father's day. After developing my feminism I had a few arguments/fights with my dad when my parents visited. After a few times my ma asked me privately "do you have some deep resentment for your dad from childhood?" because she doesn't understand why I got so mad. and that's funny to me... it's not like that at all. I do resent him but it's more retroactively and for all men, all the shit that men have given me including his. It's just when he's in the same space as me and we sort of have a close relationship (more involved/more interactions even if forced) it's hard to ignore how it's all connected and still happening and hard to hide how I feel about it all the time.
