    body: it's time to stop pretending the most violent manefestation of white supremacy is somehow separate from the more mild forms. call it out. it's not "israel is a deranged society". it's a manefestation of white supremacy and colonialism. it's not "cops are getting too violent". it's a manefestation of white supremacy and colonialism. it's not "billionaires are greedy and out of touch". it's a manefestation of colonialism and capitalism. it's all of yall(us), always. be constantly aware. this may be tiring but it's literally the foundation of you being an ally. the foundation of being an ally is NOT just willing to listen and reflect or even come to actions when called upon. it's being acutely aware of reality. if only we are on the same page about reality (as close as possible), we can act together.

    body: This is something I'm only recently* learning and slowly embodying (stating fact not excuse). trust before anything. and people don't owe their oppressors trust. when working with marginalised people that you don't share experience with or are more heavily impacted by systemic violence than u (defining comparison is hard but you'll be able to tell when u see it), they don't owe us feedback, they don't owe us "let me tell you why you fucked up" analysis. We need that, but don't wait for someone to tell you you fucked up. And if the roles are reversed we don't owe the other side that either. Accountability is truly a gift. This applies to race/white supremacy, class, disability, gender, etc

("I don't hate socks because I have a System" lol) the most common thing other people say is "if someone ask me to do a thing suddenly it becomes impossible to do the thing" and I don't feel like I relate to that. but any time there's a delayed expectation from other people or an external deadline (eg. meet up with a friend on a certain day, post thing by x date, event I want to go), often as time tick closer, i would feel an urge to just not go/prepare and cancel.

    body: the other day I talked about cooking n authenticity n basically cultural appropriation. just want to clarify that it's ok for you to take a recipe from a culture, mess with it, eat it enjoy it even cook it for others, share that recipe... just don't come on your platform and preach about "oooOooh what IS authenticity anyway" lmaoooo. also fusion is suss a lot of times. it's cool and all and the creativity and experimentation is great, but why is most of Asian/"ethnic" food expected to be cheap, while fusion is suddenly high class, especially when a white person does it? why you take an isolated element from it to "be different" while young people of our own are leaving centries old crafts behind because they will not be able to live a decent life if they choose to continue the life of the craft? why lots of traditional foods suddenly become "super food" "climate solution" when a white person pays attention to it while the general category of "ethnic food" is looked down on and traditional cultural and land knowledge is dismissed, and the place and climate those foods naturally gown are destroyed or gentrified? again... it's all connected

It's giving "I think X is better for you/I think you should control yourself and act like a normal person", it's paternalistic, it's infantalising, it's ableism and sanism. It's giving not understanding disability justice. Pls stop thinking it's something any individual should comment on as a whole. When people do this they Always make blanket statements and assumptions that are untrue. So just stop embarrasing yall selves. (this is heavily paraphrased from the original post)

      I do actually feel some kind of way when men and some others (queer folks and women is more case by case) use the word bitch in an insult and it's not really about the identity of the person. I have a problem with people using the word that way in general. But it's especially some kind of way if the person is in any way affiliated or adjacent to the identity and experience of men/masculinity (or in women's case, people who try to get safety etc by become patriarchy's helpers), and or distance from which of women. It makes me think of this quote:/ "sorry to". I'm sorry, if in an attempt to reclaim the word, you probably reinforced how women are so casually dehumanised in the general society and collective consciousness, that women's existence is a criticism anyway. I wish it doesn't work like this too, but it probably continue to be like this because the fundamental reality have not changed, despite a lot of women making progress in the society they're in. And if you were just using the word casually, really think about it more. <br>
      I've been seeing this somewhat regularly in progressive spaces (not a surprise tbh, just look at misogyny in "leftism"). And at the end of the day I don't Get A Say in how other people do things but this is my offering to you.

And now, my vision has declined so bad that even with the right prescription, I probably can't see clearly anyway in most conditions unless the object is just the perfect distance away or something. Last time I went by myself, and I wasn't even sure if "simply accept the prescription" is the right thing to do. My body felt like I'm missing a step by not arguing back. That's how it is. And doctor didn't actually give me the correct prescription anyway because I was lagging behind a lot and a big increase like that would be uncomfortable.

I want an alternative. I never buy cut veg because I hate supermarkets and they will not have a single extra cent from me. <br> also when these things are in the mainstream, it's always "convenience" (fuck convenience), "for people short on time" (we are short on time by design and it's not the only way), and even "so you can enjoy life more" (as if cutting veg is why we don't have time; specialising stuff away out of communities into factories and minmaxing activities OF LIFE is not the way to enjoy life)

    body: if I keep thinking about it, the answer is community and mutual aid and an alternative economic system fr. like if I want to unsubscribe from working for a boss/capitalist, the most common/easy-to-think-of approach is to use my skills and time to do a product or service for people who need/want it, to earn money and pay for my needs - which is a lot of work, usually not able to make living wage, and, ultimately depend on people's free cash, which I see getting smaller and smaller as capitalism eats itself. It seems impossible at each and every step because this is still operating in the same broader system and this system is anti life. <br> the alternative is, I can be (work towards being) an integral part of a community, I am there for everyone, and everyone will be there for me. the basic assumptions are completely different, which "side hustles" etc can never address. it's not about "job satisfaction", or being your own boss and being in full control, or being able to unleash your creativity, or finding your purpose. time to move out of those, we can dream bigger.

This is supposed to reward my participation and make me come back for more but it's actually only to distract from the fact that when the circle is complete, when I stop being a customer, I fall back to being the worker and I get friking exploited

    body: I feel some kind of way when popular feminists be like "oh I just don't date men", and usually it's accompanied with a sea of agreement and praise. like I guess you are free to have a personal opinion... but it's not about that it's about how it shapes the space. <br> for many of us, we can only look to an online community of feminists. the loudest voices in the online space matter. when we come across and get into a space hoping to finally make sense of things and be understood, and in some aspects you do feel seen, but then some other aspects is conflicting with your own experience, it can be confusing. especially being a poc and trying to "learn feminism" from white women lol <br> anyway... even "just not dating men/get married" comes with privilge. and remember... privilge doesn't mean you have it easy, it means some hurdles that others have to overcome is not there for you.

    body: AI art rant. I can get it if people have the desire to use it personally, altho I would't follow thru on that desire knowing it'a all stolen and using it just further normalise corporations stealing from us not just art but everything. <br> also, hot take but try to find an artist that can work with you on a small budget or even for free is still better than using AI art. (there's also obviously the choice of not involving an artist and do it yourself) If you reach out to a bunch of people, that's a start of a relationship, that's community building. skill sharing is community building. and we need to be creative about it and create alternative systems that doesn't involve money. <br> and I get that artists are sick of doing free work so this has to be non exploitative. don't just use an artist then discard them. again it's about community. this may all be a lot of work to organise but isn't that exactly the work we are doing?

    body: I think autistic people (that have certain personality traits/history (of trauma lol)) can be really good at deconstructing socialinteractions, subtext, subconscious belief that comes through in a conversation, because that's how we were able to survive and or got any love we needed. <br> but we're still not necessarily "good at socialising"? yk

    body: thinking about all the conversations that went wrong lol. and it usually happens in similar ways. we would say oh its because we are autistic. there's just some NT code  we can't crack. <br> but I see it more and more between autistic/ND people too. (and not excluding the possibility that some of these people are not actually NT and are unidentified ND?) <br> So now I'm more incliend to say the conversations "go wrong" not because some inherent differences of ND and NT people, but it's because of ableism and internalised ableism.

    body: Let's talk about the casual ableism in calling how ND people speak and interact "rude" "condesending" "arrogant", and refusing to give something you knee-jerk feel like is "rude" some benefit of the doubt... People are not ready to have a nuanced conversation about this. And this is why justice must be intersectional, include interpersonal justice, and people working towards justice all need to do healing work...

    body: Seeing a photo of an art gallery/installation and realising I have never seen things that clearly from that kind of distance 😭 I was denied access to seeing the world clearly. My ma wouldn't give me my correct prescription because she doesn't want my eyes to "rely too much on the glasses". Looking back now this is such a classic ableist line. Children is the biggest oppressed class fr.

    body: Since the most recent development of western philosophy is so dependent on individualism, I can't help but wonder what a/the indigenous field of philosophy would look like. I know China but it's not quite that comparable. I also wonder about the field of mental health/psychology the same way.

    body: Random thought on father's day. After developing my feminism I had a few arguments/fights with my dad when my parents visited. After a few times my ma asked me privately "do you have some deep resentment for your dad from childhood?" because she doesn't understand why I got so mad. and that's funny to me... it's not like that at all. I do resent him but it's more retroactively and for all men, all the shit that men have given me including his. It's just when he's in the same space as me and we sort of have a close relationship (more involved/more interactions even if forced) it's hard to ignore how it's all connected and still happening and hard to hide how I feel about it all the time.

    body: Thinking about how a lot of activism spaces can be 1) totally lacking in mad liberation and disability justice and 2) lacking in understanding of personal and collective healing, cptsd, generational trauma etc <br> but love to bring up shame! <br> do people really have a good understanding of what they're talking about when they talk about shame? can people not use it as a quick and easy lable for issues you don't know how to fix? it's giving individualism/individual responsibility over collective responsibility.
