    body: I love to see someone allow themselves to be imperfect and just START taking covid precautions again and over time gets slowly more sucked into it hahaha. satisfying <br> and this informs me that really, progress over perfection. don't worry about the messaging of this getting in the way because it usually doesn't. when people start to get a sight of the coviding community, all the information, educational materials, andpain, it's hard to look away again. we need to allow them to start.

    body: whenever I see people talk about "getting accessible things that are "more wasteful"/more expensive/"lazy" is valid" I genuinely wish we have alternatives. like community kitchen where things are made in big batches & different people can share tasks to lessen the workload etc. I don't want to just "normalise accessible things even if they are a little wasteful", I want none of it. I want an alternative. I never buy cut veg because I hate supermarkets and they will not have a single extra cent from me. <br> also when these things are in the mainstream, it's always "convenience" (fuck convenience), "for people short on time" (we are short on time by design and it's not the only way), and even "so you can enjoy life more" (as if cutting veg is why we don't have time; specialising stuff away out of communities into factories and minmaxing activities OF LIFE is not the way to enjoy life)

    body: if I keep thinking about it, the answer is community and mutual aid and an alternative economic system fr. like if I want to unsubscribe from working for a boss/capitalist, the most common/easy-to-think-of approach is to use my skills and time to do a product or service for people who need/want it, to earn money and pay for my needs - which is a lot of work, usually not able to make living wage, and, ultimately depend on people's free cash, which I see getting smaller and smaller as capitalism eats itself. It seems impossible at each and every step because this is still operating in the same broader system and this system is anti life. <br> the alternative is, I can be (work towards being) an integral part of a community, I am there for everyone, and everyone will be there for me. the basic assumptions are completely different, which "side hustles" etc can never address. it's not about "job satisfaction", or being your own boss and being in full control, or being able to unleash your creativity, or finding your purpose. time to move out of those, we can dream bigger.

    body: When we just go on and live "normally" we are actually abandoning each other. To stop abandoning and to stop being abandoned we need to act for each other. This is true with protesting our tax money going to the war machine, and true with masking against covid 19. <br> Caring (and doing) feels so difficult and "out of the way" because it isn't programmed into the system like extraction and oppressive hierarchies are.

    body: The attitude of "we can agree to disagree" *within* a marginalised community often comes from the same unwillingness to look deeper into WHY you disagree and just want surface peace/lack of obvious tension/conflict, that people can easily call out when it comes from a privilidged group/person onto said community. <br> It's giving privilege, it's giving aligning with the oppressor, it's giving  replicating the structures we claim to be taking down.

    body: I am finding... when we think of our neurodivergent traits or needs as "contradictory"... we are looking at it from a neurotypical perspective already. <br> It is because of the perspective and framing, that things look contradictory. they may not be "inherently contradictory".

    body: I think the expectation we have on ourselves to be completely consistent, and to be completely consistent in "getting better at this" can also come from a place of re-creating harmful hierarchy within ourselves, rather than the genuine(?) need to escalate.

        "What does putting the customer at the centre mean to you?" <br> It means when I'm a customer I'm supposed to be the most superior being because I make the capitalist loop of production complete, because of this I'm almost worshipped and put above other people that has different roles (like the salesperson/customer service, the "workers") at that point of the cycle (because I'm the main component). This is supposed to reward my participation and make me come back for more but it's actually only to distract from the fact that when the circle is complete, when I stop being a customer, I fall back to being the worker and I get friking exploited

    body: I feel some kind of way when popular feminists be like "oh I just don't date men", and usually it's accompanied with a sea of agreement and praise. like I guess you are free to have a personal opinion... but it's not about that it's about how it shapes the space. <br> for many of us, we can only look to an online community of feminists. the loudest voices in the online space matter. when we come across and get into a space hoping to finally make sense of things and be understood, and in some aspects you do feel seen, but then some other aspects is conflicting with your own experience, it can be confusing. especially being a poc and trying to "learn feminism" from white women lol <br> anyway... even "just not dating men/get married" comes with privilge. and remember... privilge doesn't mean you have it easy, it means some hurdles that others have to overcome is not there for you.

    body: AI art rant. I can get it if people have the desire to use it personally, altho I would't follow thru on that desire knowing it'a all stolen and using it just further normalise corporations stealing from us not just art but everything. <br> also, hot take but try to find an artist that can work with you on a small budget or even for free is still better than using AI art. (there's also obviously the choice of not involving an artist and do it yourself) If you reach out to a bunch of people, that's a start of a relationship, that's community building. skill sharing is community building. and we need to be creative about it and create alternative systems that doesn't involve money. <br> and I get that artists are sick of doing free work so this has to be non exploitative. don't just use an artist then discard them. again it's about community. this may all be a lot of work to organise but isn't that exactly the work we are doing?

    body: thinking about all the conversations that went wrong lol. and it usually happens in similar ways. we would say oh its because we are autistic. there's just some NT code  we can't crack. <br> but I see it more and more between autistic/ND people too. (and not excluding the possibility that some of these people are not actually NT and are unidentified ND?) <br> So now I'm more incliend to say the conversations "go wrong" not because some inherent differences of ND and NT people, but it's because of ableism and internalised ableism.

And this is why justice must be intersectional, include interpersonal justice, and people working towards justice all need to do healing work...

    body: Random thought on father's day. After developing my feminism I had a few arguments/fights with my dad when my parents visited. After a few times my ma asked me privately "do you have some deep resentment for your dad from childhood?" because she doesn't understand why I got so mad. and that's funny to me... it's not like that at all. I do resent him but it's more retroactively and for all men, all the shit that men have given me including his. It's just when he's in the same space as me and we sort of have a close relationship (more involved/more interactions even if forced) it's hard to ignore how it's all connected and still happening and hard to hide how I feel about it all the time.
