    body: It's icky to get paid with money/make others pay money if I do any mental health work. Money that person have to exchange with their labour prior somehow. Money that I only want because I need to "pay bills". All made up by a class of people to create scarcity and supress our natural power and agency.

    body: In a meeting when I was asked "how are you", broke the script and didn't say something to the effect of "good", my coworker started to say stuff like "don't let it get you down it's not worth it" ðŸ˜‚ <br> At that moment it really felt like there's a "script" and he's just following it ðŸ˜‚

    body: When we just go on and live "normally" we are actually abandoning each other. To stop abandoning and to stop being abandoned we need to act for each other. This is true with protesting our tax money going to the war machine, and true with masking against covid 19. <br> Caring (and doing) feels so difficult and "out of the way" because it isn't programmed into the system like extraction and oppressive hierarchies are. But we have to build the alternative world.

    body: Can we make what happened to Palestine, to the resistance happen to masking and learning up to date science covid? <br> Can people come and understand it and then support it with their whole chest & with action? Can we get that? <br> Or does it require too much inner work, too much deprogramming when it's covid?? you see what I'm talking about??

    body: The attitude of "we can agree to disagree" *within* a marginalised community often comes from the same unwillingness to look deeper into WHY you disagree and just want surface peace/lack of obvious tension/conflict, that people can easily call out when it comes from a privilidged group/person onto said community. <br> It's giving privilege, it's giving aligning with the oppressor, it's giving  replicating the structures we claim to be taking down.

    body: The fact that this so called country is genocidal becomes very obvious (once again) when you try to go to work with a mask just to protect yourself and get fired on the spot. (not me)

    body: I want to believe "mask highly encouraged" can help, but I'm struggling to actually believe so because there are little evidence. I still mostly get "hiding behind the shield of 'I have asked masks HIGHLY ENCOURAGED'" vibes bc it doesn't feel like being covid safe is *actually* a priority, combines with other little telling details...

    body: I am finding... when we think of our neurodivergent traits or needs as "contradictory"... we are looking at it from a neurotypical perspective already. <br> It is because of the perspective and framing, that things look contradictory. they may not be "inherently contradictory".

    body: I think the expectation we have on ourselves to be completely consistent, and to be completely consistent in "getting better at this" can also come from a place of re-creating harmful hierarchy within ourselves, rather than the genuine(?) need to escalate. It's just like "healing is not linear", just like no to perfectionism (internalised capitalism).

    body: so guys are now saying stuff like "girl code and girl solidarit is blinding you"?? NOT GIRL CODE bc we called the behaviour in men to protect each other to keep benefiting from & uphold the patriarchy "boy/bro code"???? THE IRONY THE LACK OF SELF AWARENESS THE SELF VICTIMISATION

    body: I really don't want to monetise things ever. If I can gather ingredients, cook for people, host a dinner/gathering (while being covid safe!!!), meal prep for people, give lessons on cooking and other skills, host sharing circles or support circles, share my writings, ANYTHING, I don't wanna charge money for that!! there are so many reasons and I just don't. If I have something you want or need I'd just give it.

    body: In revolutionary circles I feel many people have a bit of an off understanding of this "my mental health vs movement" thing. And it's not our fault, it's the systems keeping us down and pitting us against each other for crumbs. May write about this in future

    body: > 
        "What does putting the customer at the centre mean to you?" <br> It means when I'm a customer I'm supposed to be the most superior being because I make the capitalist loop of production complete, because of this I'm almost worshipped and put above other people that has different roles (like the salesperson/customer service, the "workers") at that point of the cycle (because I'm the main component). This is supposed to reward my participation and make me come back for more but it's actually only to distract from the fact that when the circle is complete, when I stop being a customer, I fall back to being the worker and I get friking exploited

    body: I feel some kind of way when popular feminists be like "oh I just don't date men", and usually it's accompanied with a sea of agreement and praise. like I guess you are free to have a personal opinion... but it's not about that it's about how it shapes the space. <br> for many of us, we can only look to an online community of feminists. the loudest voices in the online space matter. when we come across and get into a space hoping to finally make sense of things and be understood, and in some aspects you do feel seen, but then some other aspects is conflicting with your own experience, it can be confusing. especially being a poc and trying to "learn feminism" from white women lol <br> anyway... even "just not dating men/get married" comes with privilge. and remember... privilge doesn't mean you have it easy, it means some hurdles that others have to overcome is not there for you.

    body: AI art rant. I can get it if people have the desire to use it personally, altho I would't follow thru on that desire knowing it'a all stolen and using it just further normalise corporations stealing from us not just art but everything. <br> also, hot take but try to find an artist that can work with you on a small budget or even for free is still better than using AI art. (there's also obviously the choice of not involving an artist and do it yourself) If you reach out to a bunch of people, that's a start of a relationship, that's community building. skill sharing is community building. and we need to be creative about it and create alternative systems that doesn't involve money. <br> and I get that artists are sick of doing free work so this has to be non exploitative. don't just use an artist then discard them. again it's about community. this may all be a lot of work to organise but isn't that exactly the work we are doing?

    body: I think autistic people (that have certain personality traits/history (of trauma lol)) can be really good at deconstructing socialinteractions, subtext, subconscious belief that comes through in a conversation, because that's how we were able to survive and or got any love we needed. <br> but we're still not necessarily "good at socialising"? yk

    date: "2024-06-18"
    body: thinking about all the conversations that went wrong lol. and it usually happens in similar ways. we would say oh its because we are autistic. there's just some NT code  we can't crack. <br> but I see it more and more between autistic/ND people too. (and not excluding the possibility that some of these people are not actually NT and are unidentified ND?) <br> So now I'm more incliend to say the conversations "go wrong" not because some inherent differences of ND and NT people, but it's because of ableism and internalised ableism.

  - tags: []
    date: "2024-06-18"
    body: Let's talk about the casual ableism in calling how ND people speak and interact "rude" "condesending" "arrogant", and refusing to give something you knee-jerk feel like is "rude" some benefit of the doubt... People are not ready to have a nuanced conversation about this. And this is why justice must be intersectional, include interpersonal justice, and people working towards justice all need to do healing work...

    body: Seeing a photo of an art gallery/installation and realising I have never seen things that clearly from that kind of distance ðŸ˜­ I was denied access to seeing the world clearly. My ma wouldn't give me my correct prescription because she doesn't want my eyes to "rely too much on the glasses". Looking back now this is such a classic ableist line. Children is the biggest oppressed class fr.

    body: Since the most recent development of western philosophy is so dependent on individualism, I can't help but wonder what a/the indigenous field of philosophy would look like. I know China but it's not quite that comparable. I also wonder about the field of mental health/psychology the same way.

    body: Random thought on father's day. After developing my feminism I had a few arguments/fights with my dad when my parents visited. After a few times my ma asked me privately "do you have some deep resentment for your dad from childhood?" because she doesn't understand why I got so mad. and that's funny to me... it's not like that at all. I do resent him but it's more retroactively and for all men, all the shit that men have given me including his. It's just when he's in the same space as me and we sort of have a close relationship (more involved/more interactions even if forced) it's hard to ignore how it's all connected and still happening and hard to hide how I feel about it all the time.

    body: Thinking about how a lot of activism spaces can be 1) totally lacking in mad liberation and disability justice and 2) lacking in understanding of personal and collective healing, cptsd, generational trauma etc <br> but love to bring up shame! <br> do people really have a good understanding of what they're talking about when they talk about shame? can people not use it as a quick and easy lable for issues you don't know how to fix? it's giving individualism/individual responsibility over collective responsibility.
