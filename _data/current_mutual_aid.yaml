    description: >
      (words taken from Chuffed campaign) We are raising funds for a well known and beloved Darug Uncle that is experiencing extremely difficult times. During these months he has experienced numerous levels of violence at the hands of the colony.
      These include: 
      - The devastasting loss of his new born granddaughter from Covid
      - Ongoing homelessness
      - Breakdown of his permanent housing option due to racist neighbours
      - Police brutality
      - Repeated incaceration due to racial profiling and stigmatisation by police
      Funds would go towards securing permanent housing, paying off all fines and preventing any further late incursion fees and daily needs such as food and water.
