Hi I'm Phos/磷!  

I'm a 20-something Chinese person living on unceded land of the Wurundjeri and Boonwurung People (so called melbourne, australia).  
(after recent research, I think I'm on the "boarder" of these 2 lands... pretty cool)  

I'm an aspiring artist and community organiser.

Here are a few [house rules](https://phosworld.xyz/house-rules) for this website project & online interactions with me in general.  


#### welcome~ have a look around

The "**current mutual aid**" section is Another place on the internets you can go to when you want to contribute and find the information. Numbers here are also easier to copy than from instagram :)  

Long form writing will be in the "**blog**" section, and short & not-yet-developed but maybe interesting thoughts will be in the "**fragments**" section - right now it's just a copy of stuff I said on my stories and other social media and even from chats with people, sort of as a backup.  

The **projects** section is a showcase of whan I do IRL/outside of writing.  

I will also *amplify* topics & materials including: mutural aid, activism, Cov1d science, reading materials, etc. I have started to collect a list of trusted organisations/activists and useful links in the "**resources**" section.  


#### me ↔ community

##### what I offer:
(Anything irl is limited to metro so-called melbourne)
- **help with household tasks, cleaning, organising/unpacking, putting together IKEA furniture, laundry, cooking etc** (note: I do not have: NDIS registration; car or abiliity to drive; first aid training (looking to obtain))
- **meal prep** - ready made, or half prepared portioned meals, pick up or delivered to you; check what I make [here]()
- **knitting commission**
- **hand spun yarn**
- **weaving commission** (check what I made for all these crafts [here]())
- *teaching you to knit/spin/weave* (I'm not an expert so I don't know everything but I can definitely get you started!); lending you my equipment; craft and yap together
- help you with thrifting (this can take so many forms)
- *Chinese - English translation*, Chinese culture consultation, anything related to chinese cooking, help you with research and or connecting to Chinese people who are more expert on certain topics
- *non carceral, abolitionist chat/support sessions/"coaching"* - on neurodivergent related stuff, suicide ideation, being diaspora/first gen immigrant, doing community work, greif around disability, and just navigating this sick and broken colony in general. I'm not an "expert" on these topics per se, but there are the things I have lived experience with.
- work opportunities - see my resume [here]()!

I need monetary compensation for items in **bold**, and welcome monetary compensation for items in *italics*. other items are free unless you want to donate. Fees are always negociable, barter welcome, most are pay what you feel/can.

##### what I need:
- body doubling in person, in my home: once or twice a week; need to be covid safe; bonus points if you like cats and will play with my 2 babies; may need to come with me on short trips like going to the shops.
- free or VERY low fees mental health help that is decolonial, abolitionist, justice oriented, neurodivergent affirming, queer friendly, culcurally aware. (phew, tried really hard to think of all the right words!!) Does NOT need to be a "qualified" or registered mental health worker.
- free or VERY low fees assessments for "autism" and ADHD. I really don't expect someone who can provide this read my website naturally, but let me know if you have any leads!

I don't have ANY income right now (as of Feb 2025) and cannot pay in most cases but I'm hapy to barter what I can. It would be good if we can both provide something for each other, without involving money at all. And whenever I find some income I'm happy to work out pay stuff.

#### Get in touch!

I'm constantly in awe of what community can do together. Forming/finding my own sort of community recently opened up my world as a very isolated person. I'd love to make stuff happen with you! If you ever want to do something together or want to use my help, pls reach out - send me a dm on insta, discord (@phos5), bluesky, or [email](mailto:contact.phosworld@protonmail.com)! <3
