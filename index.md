Hi I'm Phos!  

I'm a 20-something Chinese femme living on unceded land of the Wurundjeri People (so called melbourne, australia).  

I like to think about things, connect dots, draw patterns.  


##### Intentions

The most fundamental intention of this website is to **be of service**. (I saw this phrasing from [this post by Maria](https://www.instagram.com/p/C2ag_8kAec7/) and I'm taking it <3)  
By organising, completing, and giving a home to my thoughts, I hope I'm creating a communual space rather than hosting a lecture. A critical but also warm and validating space, where everything is not for everyone all the time, but valuable to the right people or at the right time.  
I love chatting with people through [my Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/phomnomnom/) stories. I love the honesty, the bravery, the world-building, and I wish to continue that here. (comment function soon!!)  
Other purpose of a website are to create a more reliable and user friendly archive for my ideas and thoughts, lessen my dependence on Instagram (eat dirt Meta!!), and push forward my writing skills!  

Here are a few [house rules]() for this website project & online interactions with me in general.  


##### The "What"

I imagine I'd write mostly about "social justice" topics and adjacent. I'll also write about mental health and being neurodivergent, culture, and maybe also cooking and food, which are all political.  

Long form content will be in the "**blog**" section, and I'm thinking short & not-yet-developed but maybe interesting thoughts will be in the "**fragments**" section.  

The **projects** section is a showcase of whan I do IRL/outside of writing.  

I will also *amplify* topics & materials including: mutural aid, movement building, Cov1d science, radical reading lists, etc. I'm planning to collect a list of trusted organisations/activists and useful links in the "**resources**" section.  


##### Get in touch!

I'm constantly in awe of what community can do together. Forming/finding my own sort of community on Instagram opened up a lot of ideas for me, and I would really like to make those ideas into reality. Most of these projects depend on knowing and getting into touch with different people and collaborating. If you ever want to do something together or want to use my help, pls reach out - send me a dm on insta or [email](mailto:contact.phosworld@protonmail.com)! <3

For a comprehensive list of my skills and experiences pls see [here]().


##### Origin Story

Putting this section last because idk how many people would be interested. This has already been too long!!

I have been writing since middle school, and have always been an "overthinker" and obsessed with complex and difficult(*) philosophical and moral questions. The world often didn't make sense to me, and I have been constantly trying to understand everything in an alternative way.  

I don't remember why I started to write little notes and rants on my Instagram stories. I continued to do so because it's like a reflex - writing my thoughts down is just something I do. I didn't intend for it to "be" anything.  

2023 Oct 7 - the Al-Aqsa Flood operation by the resistance/Hamas, changed **everything**. From then to early 2024, it was a time of intense learning and un-learning and personal growth. If I was mainly watching from the sidelines before, since then I've started to actively participate the "activism" space, putting ideas into practice and using practice to inform my ideas, trying to not box myself in but also finding where am I the most effective. My use of Instagram also completely changed. I met a bunch of new friends and comrades on there, who continue to teach me, inspire me, and give me support and encouragement (ily).  

Things just became a lot more real? And I start to feel like my writing could actually be "worth something".

For this, and for recognising the role writing has always played for me, I decided to pursue it a little bit more seriously, try to give back to the community in whatever way I can, and see where this can take me.  

A lot of my writing is still going to be inspired by what I see on Instagram due to the fact that I'm still constantly learning from there & the nature of my commentary, so I'll probably sound like a chronically online person (if not already!!). That's just who I am actually and I'm not apologising for it :P  


##### Umm that's enough for introduction I think! Enjoy the website.

By the way the website is made from an open source template - [Moonwalk](https://github.com/abhinavs/moonwalk)!
