Hi I'm Phos!  

I'm a 20-something Chinese femme living on unceded land of the Wurundjeri People (so called melbourne, australia).  

I like to think about things, connect dots, draw patterns. And I try to do some online organising, mainly mutual aid.

I'm also an artist, crafter and a cook ;)


##### Intentions

The most fundamental intention of this website is to **be of service** in any way possible. (I saw this phrasing from [this post by Maria](https://www.instagram.com/p/C2ag_8kAec7/) and I'm taking it <3)  
By organising, completing, and giving a home to my thoughts, I hope to create a communual space rather than hosting a lecture. A critical but also warm and validating space, where everything is not for everyone all the time, but can be valuable to the right people or at the right time.  
I love chatting with people through [my Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/phomnomnom/) stories. I love the honesty, the bravery, the "sense-making" (hate the academic background of the phrase but love the phrase itself), world-building, and I wish to continue that here. (comment function soon!!)  
Instagram is also crashing multiple times a day for me now so I also need a place that people can find me that doesn't depend on a evil monopoly! 

Here are a few [house rules](https://phosworld.xyz/house-rules) for this website project & online interactions with me in general.  


##### The "What"

I imagine I'd write mostly about "social justice" topics and adjacent. I'll also write about mental health - healing - being neurodivergent, culture, and maybe also cooking and food, which are all political. Maybe also craft projects. Basically everything I feel may be useful to keep a record, for myself or others. 

Long form content will be in the "**blog**" section, and short & not-yet-developed but maybe interesting thoughts will be in the "**fragments**" section - right now it's just a copy of stuff I said on my stories and other social media and even from chats with people, sort of as a backup, because insta is crashing so much etc.  

The **projects** section is a showcase of whan I do IRL/outside of writing.  

I will also *amplify* topics & materials including: mutural aid, activism, Cov1d science, reading materials, etc. I'm planning to collect a list of trusted organisations/activists and useful links in the "**resources**" section.  


##### Get in touch!

I'm constantly in awe of what community can do together. Forming/finding my own sort of community on Instagram opened up a lot of ideas for me, and I would really like to make those ideas into reality. Most of these projects depend on knowing and getting into touch with different people and collaborating. If you ever want to do something together or want to use my help, pls reach out - send me a dm on insta or [email](mailto:contact.phosworld@protonmail.com)! <3


##### Origin Story

Putting this section last because idk how many people would be interested. This has already been too long!! It's not crucial but if anything I'll come through for the nosy peoples because I am one xx

I have been reading tons and making up stories since as long as I remember, writing since middle school, and have always been an "overthinker" and obsessed with how people and society work, and philosophical and moral questions that people will brand as "complex" or "difficult". (Although not much of a reader now! weird I know) I don't know if that's because the world often didn't make sense, or I just have this innate need to understand everything (common in gifted people). Probably both.  

My parents and I both knew I wouldn't be able to fit into chinese society, so I came to ~~australia~~ for university education and immigration. That's how I got connected to the "free internet" as we call it. I found out there's so much to be learned on Youtube, and then Instagram. (Not just "politics", nature, crafting, art, food, etc...)  
Somehow I started to write little notes and rants on my stories. I continued to do so because it's like a reflex - writing my thoughts down is just something I do. I didn't intend for it to "be" anything. I also started to meet people, although this did not happen very much at all until later.  

2023 Oct 7 - the Al-Aqsa Flood operation by the resistance Hamas, changed **everything**. From then to early 2024, it was a time of intense learning and un-learning and personal growth. It 
If I was mainly watching from the sidelines before, since then I've met so many more people to learn from - the important difference is almost no media will platform these people, started to actively participate the "activism" space, putting ideas into practice and using practice to inform my ideas, trying to not box myself in but also finding where am I the most effective. My use of the internet (mainly Instagram) also completely changed. I met a bunch of new friends and comrades on there, who continue to teach me, inspire me, and give me support and encouragement (ily).  

Things just became a lot more real? And I started to notice people sometimes find my writing helpful.

For this, and for recognising the role writing has always played for me, I decided to pursue it a little bit more seriously, try to give back to the community in whatever way I can, and see where this can take me.  



##### Umm that's enough for introduction I think! Enjoy the website.

By the way the website is made from an open source Jekyll template - [Moonwalk](https://github.com/abhinavs/moonwalk)!
